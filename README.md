# Uasi Book Translator

### Summary
UasiBookTranslatorPython is a Python application used to translate books and various other large text files from English to Uasi. The primary goal is to translate with 100% accuracy from English to Uasi.

### About
Uasi is an artificially language created by the Hershkovitz bros. The purpose is twofold:
1) having an encrypted means of communicating to one another
2) Having fun learning an unusual language
3) Connecting with our ancient Uasin heritage

If you are not familiar with Uasi, please refer to the [Official Website](http://uasilanguage.online)

Uasi's rules are not very complex, but there are still certain principles that must be followed in order to translate accurately from English to Uasi, or vice versa. [The Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dej4qjnA0S3Yw0IpKd5oEL2YkW4-OAcd/view?usp=share_link) is the definitive source for learning the rules of this language.

What makes automating the translation process from English to Uasi difficult is the wide array of irregularities and inconsistencies contained in the English language. Thanks to the Python library, [spaCy](https://spacy.io), the task went from impossible to conceivable.

### Setup

* Install and import the [spaCy module](https://spacy.io/models) (ensure you choose the module for "accuracy")
* Run the Python program
