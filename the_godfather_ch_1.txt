CHAPTER ONE 


Amerigo Bonasera sat in New York Criminal Court 
Number 3 and waited for justice; vengeance on the men who 
had so cruelly hurt his daughter, who had tried to dishonour her. 

The judge, a formidably heavy-featured man, rolled up the 
sleeves of his black robe as if to physically chastise the two 
young men standing before the bench. His face was cold with 
majestic contempt. But there was something fake in alfthis 
that Amerigo Bonasera sensed but did not yet understand. 

‘You acted like the worst kind of degenerates,* the judge 
said harshly. Yes, yes, thought Amerigo Bonasera. Animak. 
Animak. l^e two young men, glossy hair crew cut, scrubbed 
clean-cut faces composed into humble contrition, bowed their 
heads in submksion. 

^The judge went on. ‘You acted like wild beasts in a jungle 
and you are fortunate you did not sexually molest that poor 
girl or rd put you behind bars for twenty years.* The judge 
paused, his eyes beneath impressively thick brows flickered 
slyly towards the sallow-faced Amerigo Bonasera, then 
lowered to a stack of probation reports befdre him. He 
frowned and shrugged as if convinced against his own natural 
desire. He spoke again. 

‘But because of yotir youth, your dean records, because of 
your fine families, and b^use the law in its majesty does not 
seek vengeance, I hereby sentence you to three years’ con- 
finement to the penitentiary. Sentence to be suspended.* 

Only forty years of profosional mourning I^t the over- 
whelming frustration a^ hatred from showing on Amerigo

Bonasera’s face. His beautiful young daughter was still in the 
hospital with her broken jaw wired together; and now these 
two animaks went free? It had all been a farce. He watched the 
happy parents cluster around their darling sons. Oh, they 
were all happy now, they were smiling now. 

The black bile, sourly bitter, rose in Bonasera’s throat, over- 
flowed through tightly clenched teeth. He used his white linen 
pocket handkerchief and held it against his lips. He was stand- 
ing so when the two young men strode freely up the aisle, 
confident and cool-eyed, smiling, not giving him so much as a 
glance. He let them pass without saying a word, pressing the 
fresh linen against his mouth. 

The parents of the animaks were coming by now, two men 
and two women his age but more American in their dress. 
They glanced at him, shamefaced, yet in their eyes was an odd, 
triumphant defiance. 

Out of control, Bonasera leaned forward towards the aisle 
and shouted hoarsely, * You will weep as I have wept - I wiU 
make you weep as your children make me weep ’ - the linen at 
his eyes now. The defence attorneys bringing up the rear 
swept their clients forward in a tight little band, enveloping 
the two young men, who had started back down the aisle as if 
to protect their parents. A huge bailifiF moved quickly to block 
the row in which Bonasera stood. But it Was not necessary. 

All his years in America, Amerigo Bonasera had trusted in 
law and order. And he had prospered thereby! Now, though 
his brain smoked with hatred, though wild visions of buying a 
gun and killing the two young men jangled the very bones of 
his skull, Bonasera turned to his still uncomprehending wife 
and explained to her, *They have made fools of us.’ He paused 
and thpn made his decision, no longer fearing the cost. *For 
justice we must go on our knees to Don G>rleone.’ 

In a garishly decorated Los Angeles hotel suite, Johnny 
Fontane was as jealously drunk as any ordinary husband. 
Sprawled on a red couch, he drank straight from the bottle of 
Scotch in his hand, then washed the taste away by dunking his 
mouth in a crystalbucketoficecubes and water. It was four in the 
morning and he was spinning drunkenfimtasies of murdetinghis 

8 



trampy wife when she got home. If she ever did come home. It 
was too late to call his first wife and ask about the kids and 
he felt funny about calling any of his friends now that his career 
was plunging downhill. Hierchad becnatime when they would 
have been delighted, flattered by his calling them at four in the 
morning but now he bored them. He could even smile a little to 
himself as he thought that on ijic way up Johnny Fontanels tro- 
ubles had fascinated some of the greatest female stars in America. 

Gulping at his bottle of Scotch, he heard finally his wife’s 
key in the door, but he kept drinking until she walked into the 
room and stood before him. She was to him so very beautiful, 
the angelic face, soulful violet eyes, the delicately fragile but 
perfectly formed body. On the screen her beauty was magni- 
fied, spiritualized. A hundred million men all over the world 
were in love with the face of Margot Ashton. And paid to see 
it on the screen. 

* Where the hell were you?’ Johnny Fontane asked. 

* Out fucking,’ she said. 

She had misjudged his drunkenness. He sprang over the 
cocktai) table and grabbed her by the throat. But close up to 
that magical face, the lovely violet eyes, he lost his anger and 
became . helpless again. She made the mistake of smiling 
mockingly, saw his fist draw back. She screamed, ^Johnny, not 
in the face, I’m making a picture.’ 

She was laughing. He punched her in the stomach and .she 
fell to the floor. He fell bn top of her. He could smell her 
fragrant breath as she gasped for air. He punched her on the 
arms and on the thigh muscles of her silky tanned legs. He 
beat her as he had beaten snott^^maller kids long ago when he 
had been a tough teenager in New York’s Hell’s Kitchen. A 
painful punishment that would leave no lasting dis^guremenr 
of loosened teeth or broken nose. 

But he was not bitting her hard enough. He couldn’t. And 
she 'was giggling at him. Spread-eagl^ on the floor, her 
brocaded gown hitched up atove her thighs, she taunted him 
between giggles. *Comc on, stick it in. Stick it in, Johnny, 
that’s what you really want.’ 

Johnny Fontane got up. He hated the woman on the floor, 
but her beauty was a magic shield. Margot rolled away, and tn 


9 



a daticer’s spring was on her feet £icing him. She went into a 
childish mocking dance and chanted^ * Johnny never hurt me, 
Johnny never hurt me.* Then almost sadly with grave beauty 
she said, ‘You poor silly bastard, giving me cramps like a kid. 
Ah, Johnny, you always will be a dumb romantic guinea, you 
even make love like a Idd. You still think screwing is really like 
those dopey songs you used to sing.* She shook her head smd 
said, ‘Poor Johnny. Goodbye, Johnny.* She walked into the 
bedroom and he heard her turn the key in the lock. 

Johnny sat on the floor with his fltce in his hands. The sick, 
humiliating despair overwhelmed him. And then the gutter 
toughness that had helped him survive the jungle of Holly- 
wood made him pick up the phone and call for a car to take 
him to the airport. There was one person who could save 
him. He would go back to New York. He would go back to 
the one man with the power, the wisdom, he needed and a love 
he still trusted. His Godfather Corleone. 

The baker, Na 2 orine, pudgy and crusty as his great Italian 
loaves, still dusty with flour, scowled at his wife, his nubile 
daughter, Katherine, and his baker’s helper, Enao. Bozo had 
changed into his prisoner-of-war uniform with its green- 
lettered armband and was terrified that this scene would make 
him late reporting back to Governor’s Island. One of the 
many thousands of Italian Army prisoners paroled daily to 
work in the American economy, he lived in constant fear of 
that parole being revoked. And so the* little comedy being 
play^ now 'was, for him, a serious business. 

Nazorine asked fiercely, ‘Have you dishonoured my fiunily? 
Have you given my daughter a litde package to remember you 
by npw that the war is over and you know America will Idck 
your ass back to your village full of shit in Sicily?* 

Enzo, a very short, strongly built boy, put his hmd oirer his 
heart and said almost in tears, yet clevedy, *Padram^ Iswcatrhy 
the Holy Virgin I have never taken advantage of your kind- 
ness. 1 love your daughter with all reQ>ect. 1 asl^ for her 
band widi all respect. 1 know 1 have no right, but if they send 
me back to Italy I can never come back to America. 1 will 
never be able to marry Katherine.* 


lO 



Na2odne*s wife, Filomena, spoke to the point. ‘ Stop all this 
foolishness/ she said to her pudgy husband. * You know what 
you must, do. Keep Enzo here, send him to hide with our 
cousins in Long Island.’ 

Katherine was weeping. She was already plump, homely, and 
sprouting a faint moustache. She would never get a husband as 
Iiandsome as Enzo, never find another man who touched her 
body in secret places with such respectful love. ‘ I’ll go and live 
in Italy,’ she screamed at her father. ‘I’ll run away if you don’t 
keep Enzo here.’ 

Nazorine glanced at her shrewdly. She was a ‘hot number’ 
this daughter of his. He had seen her brush her swelling 
buttocks .against Enzo’s front when the baker’s helper 
squeezed behind her to fill the counter baskets with hot loaves 
from the oven. The young rascal’s hot loaf would be in 
oven, Nazorine thought lewdly, if proper steps were not 
taken. Enzo must be kept in America and be made an American 
citizen. And there was only one man who could arrange $uch 
an afEsir, The Godfather. Don Corleone. 

All of these people and many others received engraved 
invitations to the wedding of Miss Constanzia Corleone, to be 
celebrated on the last Saturday in August 1945. The father of 
the bride, Don Vito Corleone, never forgot his old friends and 
neighbours though he himself now lived in a huge house on 
Long Island. The reception would be held in that house and 
the festivities would go on all day. There was no doubt it 
would be a momentous occasion. Ihe war with the Japanese 
had just ended, so there would not be any nagging fear for 
their sons fighting in the Army to cloud these festivities. A 
wedding was just what people needed to show their joy. . 

And so on that Saturday morning the friends of Don Cor* 
leone streamed out of New York City to do him honour. They 
bore cream-coloured envelopes stuffed with cash as bridal 
gifts, no cheques. Inside each envelope a card established the 
identity of the giver and the measure of his respect for the 
Godfiither. A respect truly earned. 

Don Vito torlcone was a man to whom everybody came 
for help, and never were they disappointed. He made no 


II 



empty promises, nor the craven excuse that bis hands were 
tied by more powerful forces in the world than himself. It was 
not necessary that he be your friend, it was not even important 
that you had no means with which to repay him. Only one 
thing was required. That you, joh ytutrseJf^ proclaim your 
friendship. And then, no matter how poor or powerless the 
supplicant, Don Corleone would take that man's troubles to 
his heart. And he would let nothing stand in the way to a 
solution of that man’s woe. His reward? Friendship, the 
respectful title of ‘Don*, and sometimes the more affectionate 
salutation of ‘Godfather’. And perhaps, to show respect only, 
never for profit, some humble gift - a gallon of homemade 
wine or a basket of peppered iarclUs specially baked to grace 
his Christmas table. It was understo^ it was mete good 
manners, to proclaim that you were in his debt and that he 
had the right to call upon you at any time to redeem your 
debt by some small service. 

Now on this great day, his daughter’s wedding day, Don 
Vito Corleone stood in the doorway of his Long Beach home 
to greet his guests, all of them known, all of them trusted. 
Many of them owed their good fortune in life to the Don and 
on this intimate occasion felt free to call him ‘Godfather’ to 
his face. Even the people performing festal services were his 
friends. The bartender was an old comrade whose gift was all 
the wedding liqueurs and his own expert skills. The waiters 
were the friends of Don Corleone’s sons. The food on the 
garden picnic tables had been cooked by the Don’s wife and 
her friends, and the gaily festooned one-acre garden itself had 
been decorated by the young girl-chums of the bride. 

Don Corleone received everyone - rich and poor, powerful 
and humble - with an equal show of love. He slighted no one. 
That was his character. And the guests so exclaimed at bow 
well he looked in his tux that an inexperienced observer might 
easily have thought the Don himself was the lucky groom. 

Standing at the door with him were two of his three sons. 
The eldest, baptized Santino but called Sonny by everyone 
except his father, was looked at askance by the older Italian 
men; with admiration by the younger. Sonny Corleone was 
tall for a first-generation American of Italian parentage. 


12 



almost six feet, and his crop of bushy, curly hair made liim 
look even taller. His face was that of a gross Cupid, the 
features even but the bow-shaped lips thickly sensual, the 
dimpled cleft chin in some curious way obscene. He was built 
as powerfully as a bull, and it was common knowledge that he 
was so generously endowed by nature that his martyred wife 
feared the marriage bed as unbelievers once feared the rack. 
It was whispered that when as a youth he had visited houses of 
iU fame, even the most hardened and fearless putain^ after an 
awed inspection of his massive organ, demanded double 
price. 

Here at the wedding feast, some young matrons, wide- 
hipped, wide-mouthed, measured Sonny Corleonc with cooDy 
confident eyes. But on this particular day they were wasting 
their time. Sonny Corleone, despite the presence of his wife 
and three small children, had plans for his sister’s maid of 
honour, Lucy Mancini. This young girl, fully aware, sat at a 
garden table iti her pink formal gown, a tiara of dowers in her 
glossy black hair. She had dirted with Sonny in the past week 
of rehearsals and squeezed his hand that morning at the altar. 
A maiden could do no more. 

She did not care that he ^ ould never be the great man his 
father had proved to be. Sonny Corleonc had strength, he had 
courage. He was generous and his heart was admitted to be as 
big as his organ. Yet he did not have his father’s humility but 
instead a quick, hot temper that led him into errors of judge- 
ment. Though he was a great help in his father’s business, 
there were many who doubted that he would become the 
heir to it. 

The second son, Frcdcrico, called Fred or Frtdo, was a 
child every Italian prayed to the saints for. Dutiful, loyal, 
always at the service of Us father, living with his patents at age 
thirty. He was short and burly, not handsome but with the 
same Cupid head of the famOy, the curly helmet of hair over 
the round face and sensual bow-shaped Kps. Only, in Fred, 
these lips were not sensual but graniteKke. Inclined to dour- 
ness, he was stiU a crutch to his &ther, never disputed him, 
never embarrassed him by scandalous behaviour with women. 
Despite all these virtues, he did not have that personal 

15 



magnetism, that animal force, so necessary for a leader of men, 
and he, too, was not expected to inherit the family business. 

The third son, Michael Corleone, did not stand with his 
father and his two brothers but sat at a table in the most 
secluded corner of the garden. But even there he could not 
escape the attentions of the family friends. 

Michael Corleone was the youngest son of the Don and the 
only child who had refused the great man’s direction. He did 
not have the heavy, Cupid-shaped face of the other children, 
and. his jet black hair was straight rather than curly. His skin 
was a clear olive-brown that would have been called beautiful 
in a girl. He was handsome in a delicate way. Indeed there had 
been a time when the Don had worried about his youngest 
son’s masculinity. A worry that was put to rest when Michael 
Corleone became seventeen years old. 

Now this youngest son sat at a table in the extreme comer 
of the garden to proclaim his chosen alienation from father 
and family. Beside him sat the American girl everyone had 
heard about but whom no one had seen until this day. He had, 
of course, shown the proper respect and introduced her to 
everyone at the wedding, including his family. They were not 
impressed with her. She was too thin, she was too fair, her 
face was too sharply intelligent for a woman, her manner too 
free for a maiden. Her name, too, was outlandish to their 
ears ; she called herself Kay Adams. If she had told them that 
her family had settled in America two hundred years ago and 
her name was a common one, they would have shrugged. 

Every guest noticed that the Don paid no particular atten- 
tion to this third son. Michael had been hiS favourite before 
the vfar and obviously the chosen heir to run the family 
business when the proper moment came. He had all the quiet 
force and intelligence of his great father, the born instinct to 
act in such a way that men had no recourse but to respect him. 
But when World War II broke out, Michael Corleone volun- 
teered for the Marine Corps. He defied his father’s express 
command when he did so. 

Don Corleone had no desire, no intention, of letdng his 
youngest son be killed in the service of a power foreign to 
hims^. Doctors had been bribed, secret arrangements had 

M 



been made. A gteat deal of money had been spent to take*the 
proper precautions. But Midbael was twenty-one years of age 
and nothing could be done against his own wilfulness. He 
enlisted and fought over the Pacific Ocean. He became a 
Captain and won medals. In 1944 his picture was printed in 
Uft magazine with a 'photo layout of his deeds. A friend had 
shown Don Corleone the magazine (his family did not dare), 
and the Don had grunted disdainfully and said, ‘ He performs 
those miracles for strangers.’ 

When Michael Corleone was discharged early in 1945 to 
recover from a disabling wound he had no idea that his father 
had arranged his release. He stayed home for a few weeks, 
then, without consulting anyone, entered Dartmouth College 
in Hanover, New Hampshire, and so he left his father’s house. 
To return for the wedding of his sister and to show his own 
future wife to them, the washed-out rag of an American girl. 

Michael Corleone was amusing Kay Adams by telling her 
Uttle stories about some of the more colourful wedding guests. 
He was, in turn, amused by her finding these people exotic, 
and, as always, charmed by her intense interest in anything 
new and foreign to her experience. Finally her attention was 
caught by a small group of men gathered around a wooden 
barrel of homemade wine. The men were Amerigo Bonasera, 
Nazorine the baker, Anthony Coppola, and Luca Brasi. With 
her usual alert intelligence she remarked on the fact that these 
four men did not seem particularly happy. Michael smiled. 

•No, they’re not,’ he said. ^They’re waiting to see my father 
in private. They have favours to ask.’ And indeed it was easy to 
see that all four men constantly followed the Don with their eyes. 

As Don Corleone stood greeting guests, a black Chevrolet 
sedan came to a stop on the far side of the paved mall. Two 
men in the front seat puUed notebooks from their jackets and, 
with no attempt at concealment, jotted down licence numbers 
of the other cars parked around tne mall. Sonny turned to his 
father and said, ‘Those guys over there must be cops.’ 

Don Corleone shrugged. ‘1 don’t own the street. They can 
do what they please.’ 

Sonny’s heavy Cupid fyot grew ted with anger. ‘Those 



lousy bastards, they don’t respect anything.* He left the steps 
of the house and walked across the mall to where the black 
sedan was parked. He thrust his face angrily close to the face 
of the driver, who did not flinch but flapped open his wallet 
to show a green identification card. Sonny stepped back 
without saying a word. He spat so that the spittle hit the back 
door of the sedan and walked away. He was hoping the driver 
would get out of the sedan and come after him, on the mall, 
but nothing happened. When he reached the steps he said to 
his father, ‘Those guys arc FBI men. They’re taldng down all 
the licence numbers. Snotty bastards.’ 

Don Corlcone knew who they were. His closest and most 
intimate friends had been advised to attend the wedding in 
automobiles not their own. And though he disapproved of his 
son’s foolish displa^^ of auger, the tantrum served a purpose. It 
would convince the interlopers that their presence was un- 
expected and unprepared for. So Don Corlcone himself was 
not angry. He had long ago learned that society imposes 
insults that must be borne, comforted by the knowledge that 
in this world there comes a time when the most humble of 
men, if he keeps his eyes open, can take his revenge on the 
most powerful. It was this knowledge that prevented the Don 
from losing the humility all his friends admired in him. 

But now in the garden behind the house, a four-piece band 
began to play. All the guests had arrived. Don Corlcone put the 
intruders out of his mind and led his two sons to the wedding 
feast. 

There were, now, hundreds of guests in the huge garden, 
some dancing on the wooden platform bedecked with fl.owcrs, 
others' sitting at long tables piled high with spicy food and 
gallon jugs of black, homemade wine. The bride, Connie 
Corlcone, sat in splendour at a special raised table with her 
groon\ the maid of honour, bridesmaids, and ushers. It was a 
rustic setting in the old Italian style. Not to the bride’s taste, but 
Connie had consented to a ‘ guinea ’ wedding to please her father 
because she had so displeasured him in her choice of a husband. 

The groom. Carlo Rixzi, was a half-breed, bom of a Sicilian 
fiither and the North Italian mother from whom he had 

i6 



inherited his blond hair and blue eyes. His parents li^ed in 
Nevada and Carlo had left that state because of a little trouble 
with the law. In New York he met Sonny Corleone and so met 
the sister. Don Corleone, of course, sent trusted friends to 
Nevada and they reported that Carlo’s police trouble was a 
youthful indiscretion with a gun, not serious, that could 
easily be wiped off the books to leave the youth with a dean 
record. They also came back with detailed information on legal 
gambling in Nevada which greatly interested the Don and 
which he had been pondering over since. It was part of the 
Don's greatness that he profited from everything. 

Connie Corleone was a not quite pretty girl, thin and 
nervous and certain to become shrewish later in life. But 
today, transformed by her white bridal gown and eager 
virginity, she was so radiant as to be almost beautiful. Beneath 
the wooden table her hand rested on the muscular thigh of her 
groom. Her Cupid-bow mouth pouted to give him an airy 
Uss. 

She thought him incredibly handsome. Carlo Rizzi had 
worked in the open desert air while very young - heavy 
labourer’s work. Now he had tremendous forearms and his 
shoulders bulged the jacket of his tux. He basked in the 
adoring eyes of his bride and filled her glass with wine. He 
was elaborately courteous to her as if they were both actors in 
a play. But his eyes kept flickering towards the huge silk purse 
the bride wore on her right shoulder and whic^ was now 
stuffed full of money envelopes. How much did it hold? Ten 
thousand? Twenty thousand? Carlo Rizzi smiled. It was only 
the beginning. He had, after all, married into a royal family. 
They would have to take cate of him. , 

In the crowd of guests a dapper young man with the sleek 
head of a ferret was also studying the silk purse. From sheer 
habit Paulie Gatto wondered just how he could go about 
hijacking that fat pocketbook. The idea amused him. But he 
knew it was idle, innocent dreaming, as small children dream 
of knocking out tanks with pop-guns. He watched his boss, fat, 
middle-aged Peter Qemenza whiding young girls around the 
wooden dance floor in a rustic and lusty TaranttUa, Qemenza, 
immensely tall, immensely huge, danced with such skill and 



abandon, his hard belly lecherously bumping the breasts of 
younger, tinier women, that all the guests were applauding 
him. Older women grabbed his arm to become his next 
partner. The younger men respectfully cleared off the floor and 
clapped their hands in time to the mandolin’s wild strumming. 
When Qemenaa finally collapsed in a chair, Paulie Gatto 
brought him a glass of icy. black wine and wiped the per- 
spiring Jovelike brow with his silk handkerchief. Clemenaa 
was blowing like a whale as he gulped down the wine. But 
instead of thanking Paulie he said curtly, * Never mind being a 
dance judge, do your job. Take a walk around the neighbour- 
hood and see everything is OK.’ Paulie slid away into the 
crowd. 

The band took a refreshment break. A young man named 
Nino Valenti picked up a discarded mandolin, put his left foot 
up on a chair, and began to sing a coarse Sicilian love song. 
Nino Valenti’s face was handsome though bloated by con- 
tinual drinking and he was already a little drunk. He rolled his 
eyes as his tongue caressed the obscene lyrics. The women 
shrieked with glee and the men shouted the last word of each 
stanza with the singer. 

Don Corleone, notoriously straitlaced in such matters, 
though his stout wife was screaming jo3rfully with the others, 
disappeared tactfully into the house. Seeing this. Sonny 
Corleone made his way to the bride*s table and sat down 
beside young Lucy Mancini, the maid of honour. They were 
safe. His wife was in the kitchen putting the last touches on the 
serving of the wedding cake. Sonny whispered a few words in 
the young girl’s ear and she rose. Sonny waited a few minutes 
and then casually followed her, stopping to talk with a guest 
here and there as he worked his way through the crowd. 

All eyes followed them. The maid of honour, thoroughly 
Americanized by three years of college, was a ripe girl who 
already had a ‘reputation*. All through the marriage re- 
hearsals she had flirted with Sonny Corleone in a teasing, 
joking way she thought was permitted because he was the best 
man and her wedding partner. Now holding her pink gown up 
off the ground, Lucy Mancini went into the house, smiling 
with false innocence, ran lightly up the stairs to ^e bath- 

18 



room. She stayed there for a few moments. When she came out 
Sonny Cotkone was on the landing above, beckoning her 
upward. 

From behind the closed window of Don Codeone’s * ofiice', 
a slightly raised corner room, Thomas Hagen watched the 
wedding party in the festooned garden. The walls behind 
him were stacked with law books. Hagen was the Don’s 
lawyer and acting Consigiiori^ or counsellor, and as such held 
the most vital subordinate position in the family business* He 
and die Don had solved many a knotty problem in this room, 
and so when he saw the Gc^ather leave the festiviues and 
enter the house, he knew, wedding or no, there would be a 
litde work this day. The Don would be coming to see him. 
Then Hagen saw Sonny Corleone whisper in Lucy Mancini’s 
ear and their litde comedy as he followed her into the house. 
Hagen grimaced, debated whether to inform the Don, and 
decided against it. He went to the desk and picked up a hand- 
written list of the people who had been granted permission to 
see Don Corleone privately. When the Don entered the room 
Hagen handed him the list. Don Corleone nodded and said, 
’Leave Bonasera to the end. ’ 

Hagen used the french doors and went directly out into the 
garden to where the supplicants clustered around the barrel of 
wine. He pointed to the baker, the pudgy Nazorine. 

Don Corleone greeted the baker with an embrace. They had 
played together as children in Italy and had grown up in 
friendship. Every Easter freshly baked clotted-cheese and 
wheat-germ pies, their crusts yolk-gold, big around as truck 
wheels, surrived at Don Corleone’s home. On Christmas, on 
fiunily birthdays, rich creamy pastries proclaimed* the Nazo- 
rines* respect. And all through the years, lean and fat, Nazo- 
rine cheerfully paid his dues to the l^ery union organized by 
the Don in his salad days. Never asking for a favour in return 
except for the chance to buy black-market OPA sugar 
coupons during the war. Now the time had come for the baker 
to oaim his rights as a loyal friend, and Don Corleone looked 
forward '4rith great pleasure to granting his request. 

He gave the baker a Di Nobili cigar and a glass of ydlow 
Stt^and put his hand on the man’s shotdder to urge him on. 


19 



That was the mark of the Don’s humanity. He knew from 
bitter experience what courage it took to ask a favour from a 
fellow man. 

The baker told the story of his daughter and Enzo. A fine 
Italian lad from Sicily; captured by the American Army; sent 
to the United States as a prisoner of war; given parole to help 
our war effort! A pure and honourable love had sprung up 
between honest Enzo and his sheltered Katherine, but now 
that the war was ended the poor lad would be repatriated to 
Italy and Nazorine’s daughter would surely die of a broken 
heart. Only Godfather Corleone could help this afflicted 
couple. He was their last hope. 

The Don walked Nazorine up and down the room, his hand 
on the baker’s shoulder, his head nodding with understanding 
to keep up the man’s courage. When the baker had finished 
Don Corleone smiled at him and said, ‘ My dear friend, put all 
your worries aside.’ He went on to explain very carefully what 
must be done. The Congressman of the district must be 
petitioned. The Congressman would propose a special bill that 
would allow Enzo to become a citizen. The bill would surely 
pass Congress. A privilege all those rascals extended to each 
other. Don Corleone explained that this would cost money, 
the going price was now two thousand dollars. He, Don 
Corleone, would guarantee performance and accept payment. 
Did his friend agree? 

The baker nodded his head vigorously. He did not expect 
such a great favour for nothing. That was understood. A 
special Act of Congress docs not come cheap. Nazorine was 
almost tearful in his thanks. Don Corleone walked him to the 
door, assuring him that competent people would be sent to the 
bakery*to arrange all details, complete all necessary documents. 
The baker embraced him before disappearing into the 
garden. 

Hagen smiled at the Don. ‘That’s a good investment for 
Nazorine. A son-in-law and a cheap lifetime helper in his 
bakery all for two thousand dollars.’ He paused. ‘Who do I 
give this job to?* 

Don Corleone frowi^d in thought. ‘Nor to our paisan. Give 
it to the Jew in the next district. Have the home addresses 


ao 



changed. 1 think thete might be many such cases now the war 
is over; we should have extra people in Washington that can 
handle the overflow and not raise the price.’ Hagen made a 
note on his pad. ‘Not Congressman Luteco. Try Fischer.’ 

The next man Hagen brought in was a very simple case. His 
name was Anthony Coppola and he was the son of a man Don 
Corleone had worked with in the railroad yards in his youth. 
Coppola needed five hundred dollars to open a pizzeria ; for a 
deposit on fixtures and the special oven. For reasons not 
gone into, credit was not available. The Don reached into his 
pocket and took out a roll of bills. It was not quite enough. He 
grimaced and said to Tom Hagen, ‘Loan me a hundred 
dollars, I’ll pay you back Monday when I go to the bank.’ The ' 
supplicant protested that four hundred dollars would be 
ample, but Don Corleone patted his shoulder, saying, apolo- 
getically, ‘This fancy wedding left me a little short of cash.’ 
He took the money Hagen extended to him and gave it to 
Anthony Coppola with his own roll of bills. 

Hagen watched with quiet admiration. The Don always 
taught that when a man was generous, he must show the 
generosity as personal. How flattering to Anthony Coppola 
that a man like the Don would borrow to loan him money. Not 
that Coppola did not know that the Don was a millionaire, but 
how many millionaires let themselves be put to even a small 
inconvenience by a poor friend? 

The Don raised his head inquiringly. Hagen said, ‘He’s not 
on the h'st but Luca Brasi wants to see you. He understands it 
can’t be public but he wants to congratulate you in person.’ 

For the first time the Don seemed displeased. The answer 
was devious. ‘Is it necessary?’ he asked. , 

Hagen shrugged. ‘You understand him better than I do. 
But he was very grateful that you invited him to the wedding. 
He never expected that. I think he wants to show his gratitude.’ 

Don Corleone nodded and gestured that Luca Brasi should 
be brought to him. 

In the garden Kay Adams was struck by the violet fury 
imprinted on the face of Luca Brasi. She asked about him. 
Michael had brought Kay to the wedding so that she would 
slowly, and perhaps without too much of a shock, absorb the 


21 



tnith about his father. But so fat she seemed to regard the 
Don as a slightly unethical businessman. Michael decided to 
tell her part of the truth indirectly. He explained that Luca 
Brasi was one of the most feared men in the Eastern under- 
world. His great talent, it was said, was that he could do a job 
of murder all by himself, without confederates, which auto- 
matically made discovery and conviction by the law almost 
impossible. Michael grimaced and said, don’t know whether 
all that stuff is true. I do know he is sort of a friend to my 
Bither.’ 

For the first time Kay began to understand. She asked a little 
incredulously, * You’re not hinting that a man like that works 
for your father?’ 

llie heU with it, he thought. He said, straight out, ‘Nearly 
fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father’s 
oil importing business. They tried to kill him and nearly did. 
Luca Brasi went after them. The story is that he killed six men 
in two weeks and that ended the famous olive oil war.’ He 
smiled as if it were a joke. 

Kay shuddered. ‘You mean your father was shot by 
gangsters?’ 

‘Fifteen years ago,’ Michael said. ‘Everything’s been peace- 
ful since then.’ He was afraid he had gone too far. 

‘You're trying to scare me,’ Kay said. ‘You just don’t want 
me to marry you.’ She smiled at him and poked his ribs with 
her elbow. ‘Very clever.’ 

Michael smiled back at her. ‘1 want you to think about it,’ he 
said. 

‘Did he really kill six men?’ Kay asked. 

‘That’s what the newspapers claimed,’ Mike said. ‘Nobody 
ever proved it. But there’s another story about him that 
nobody ever tells. It’s supposed to be so terrible that even my 
father won’t talk about it. Tom Hagen knows the story and he 
won’t tell me. Once I kidded him, 1 said, “When will I be old 
enough to hear that story about Luca?’’ and Tom said, “When 
you’re a hundred.”' Michael sipped his glass of wine. ‘That 
must be some story. That must be some Luca.’ 

Luca Brasi was indeed a man to frighten the devil in hell 
himself. Short, squat, massive-skulled, his presence sent out 


22 



aknn bdb of danger. HU &ce vas stamped into a mask of 
fury. The eyes were brown but with none of the warmth 
of that colour, more a deadly tan. The mouth was not so 
much cruel as lifeless; thin, rubbery, and the colour of 
veal. 

Brasi’s reputation for violence was awesome and his devo- 
tion to Don Corleone legendary. He was, in himself, one of the 
great blocks that supported the Don’s power structure. His 
kind was a rarity. 

Luca Brasi did not feat the police, he did not fear society, he 
did not fear God, he did not fear hell, he did not fear or love 
his fellow man. Put he had elected, he had chostn^ to fear and 
love I>on Corleone. Ushered into the presence of the Don, the 
terrible Brasi held himself sti£F with respect. He stuttered over 
the flowery congratulations he offered and his formal hope 
that the first grandchild would be masculine. He then handed 
the Don an envelope stuffed with cash as a gift for the bridal 
couple. 

So that was what he wanted to do. Hagen noticed the 
change in Don Corleone. The Don received Brasi as a king 
greets a subject who has done him an enormous service, never 
fiimiliar but with regal respect. With every gesture, with every 
word, Don Corleone made it clear to Luca Brasi that he was 
pahtid. Not for one moment did he show surprise at the 
wedding gift being presented to him personally. He under- 
stood. 

The money in the envelope was sure to be more than anyone 
else had given. Brasi had spent many hours deciding on the 
sum, comparing it to what the other guests might offer. He 
wanted to be the most generous to show that he h^d the most 
respect, and that was why he had given his envdope to the 
Don personally, a gauchc^e the Don overlooked in his own 
flowery sentence of thanks. Hagen saw Luca Brasi’s face lose 
its mask of fury, swell with pdde and pleasiire, Brasi kissed the 
Don’s hand before he went out the door that Hagen held 
open. Hagen prudently gave Brasi a fdendly smile which the 
squat man admowledged with a polite stretdung of rubbery, 
veal-coloured lips. 

^ When the door closed Don Corleone gave a small sigh of 

*1 



relief. Brasi was the only man in the world who could make 
him nervous. The man was like a natural force, not truly 
subject to control. He had to be handled as gingerly as dyna- 
mite. The Don shrugged. Even dynamite could be exploded 
harmlessly if the need arose. He looked qucstioningly at 
Hagen. 'Is Bonasera the only one left?’ 

Hagen nodded. Don Corleone frowned in thought, then 
said, ‘ Before you bring him in, teU Santino to come here. He 
should learn some things.* 

Out in the garden, Hagen searched anxiously for Sonny 
Corleone. He told the waiting Bonasera to be patient and went 
over to Michael Corleone and his girlfriend. ‘Did you sec 
Sonny around?’ he asked. Michael shook his head. Damn, 
Hagen thought, if Sonny was screwing the maid of honour all 
this time there was going to be a mess of trouble. His wife, the 
young girl’s family; it could be a disaster. Anxiously he 
hurried to the entrance through which he had seen Sonny 
disappear almost a half hour ago. 

Seeing Hagen go into the house, Kay Adams asked Michael 
Corleone, *Who is he? You introduced him as your brother, 
but his name is different and be certainly doesn’t look Italian.’ 

‘Tom lived with us since he was twelve years old,’ Michael 
said. ‘His parents died and he was roaming around the streets 
with this bad eye infection. Sonny brought him home one 
night and he just stayed. He didn’t have any place to go. He 
lived with us until he got married.’ 

Kay Adams was thrilled. ‘That’s really romantic,’ she said. 
‘Your father must be a warmhearted person. To adopt some- 
body just like that when he had so many children of his own.’ 

Michael didn’t bother to point out that immigrant Italians 
considered four children a smaU family. He merely said, 'Tom 
wasn’t adopted. He just lived with us.’ 

‘Oh,’ Kay said, then asked curiously, ‘why didn’t you adopt 
him?’ 

Michael laughed. ‘Because my father said it would be dis- 
respectful for Tom to change his name. Disrespectful to his 
own parents.’ 

They saw Hagen shoo Sonny through the french door into 
the Don’s office and then crook a finger at Amerigo Bonasera. 


M 



'Why do they bother your father with business on a day like 
this?’ Kay asked. 

Michael laughed again. ' Because they know that by tradition 
no Sicilian can refuse a request on his daughter’s wedding 
day. And no Sicilian erer lets a chance like that go by.’ 

Lucy Manciiii lifted her pink gown oH^ the floor and ran up 
the steps. Sonny Corleone’s heavy Cupid face, redly obscene 
with winey lust, frightened her, but she had teased him for the 
past week to just this end. In her two college love affairs she 
had felt nothing and neither of them lasted more than a week. 
Quarrelling, her second lover had mumbled something about 
her being 'too big down there’. Lucy had understood and for 
the rest of the school term had reused to go out on any 
dates. 

During the summer, preparing for the wedding of her best 
friend, Connie Corleone, Lucy heard the whispered stories 
about Sonny. One Sunday afternoon in the Corleone kitchen. 
Sonny’s wife Sandra gossiped freely. Sandra was a coarse, 
good-natured woman who had been born in Italy but brought 
to America as a small child. She was strongly built with great 
breasts and had already borne three children in five years of 
marriage. Sandra and the other women teased Connie about 
the terrors of the nuptial bed. *My God,’ Sandra had giggled, 
'when I saw that pole of Sonny’s for the first time and realized 
he was going to stick it into I yelled bloody murder. After 
the first year my insides felt as mushy as macaroni boiled for 
an hour. When I heard he was doing the job on other girls I 
went to church and lit a candle.’ 

They had all laughed, but Lucy had felt her flesh twitching 
between her legs. 

Now as she ran up the steps towards Sonny a tremendous 
flash of desire went through her body. On the landing Sonny 
grabbed her hand and pulled her down the hall into an empty 
i^droom. Her legs went weak as the door dosed behind them. 
She fdt Sonny’s moudi on hers, his lips tasting of burnt 
tobacco, bitter. She opened her mouth. At that moment she 
felt his hand come up beneath her bridesmaid’s gown, heard 
die rusde of material giving way, fidt his large warm hand 


*5 



between her legs, tipping aside the satin panties to caress her 
vulva. She put her arms around his neck and hung there as he 
opened his trousers. Then be placed both hands beneath her 
bare buttocks and lifted her. She gave a little hop in the air so 
that both her legs were wrapped around his upper thighs. His 
tongue was in her mouth and she sucked on it. He gave a 
savage thrust that banged her head against the door. She felt 
something burning pass between her thighs. She let her right 
hand drop from his neck and reached down to guide him . 
Her hand closed around an enormous, blood-gorged pole of 
muscle. It pulsated in her hand like an animal and almost 
weeping with grateful ecstasy she pointed it into her own wet, 
turgid flesh. The thrust of its entering, the unbelievable 
pleasure made her gasp, brought her legs up almost around his 
neck, and then like a quiver, her body received the savage 
arrows of his lightning-like thrusts; innumerable, torturing; 
arching her pelvis higher and higher until for the first time in 
her life she reached a shattering climax, felt his hardness break 
smd then the crawly flood of semen over her thighs. Slowly 
her legs relaxed from around his body, slid down until they 
reach^ the floor. They leaned against each other, out of 
breath. 

It might have been going on for ;8ome time, but now they 
could hear the soft knocking on the door. Sonny quickly 
buttoned his trousers, meanwhile blocking the door so that it 
could not be opened. Lucy frantically smoothed down her 
pink gown, her eyes flickering, but the thing that had given 
her so much pleasure was hidden inside sober black cloth. 
Then they heard Tom Hagen’s voice, very low, ‘Sonny, you 
in there?’ 

Sonhy sighed with relief. He winked at Lucy. ‘Yeah, Tom, 
what is it?’ 

Hagen’s voice, still low, said, ‘The Don wants you in his 
oflice. Now.’ They could hear his footsteps as he walked away. 
Sonny waited for a few moments, gave Lucy a hard kiss on t^ 
lips, and then slipped out the door after Hagen. 

Lucy combed her hair. She checked her dress and pulled 
around her garter straps. Her body felt bruised, her lips pulpy 
and tender. She went out the door; and though she felt the 

a6 



sticky wetness between het thighs she did not go to the bath- 
room to wash but ran straight on down the steps and into the 
garden. She took her seat at the bridal table next to Q>nnie, 
who exclaimed petulantly, ‘Lucy, where were you? You look 
drunk. Stay beside me now.* 

The blond groom poured Lucy a glass of wine and smiled 
knowingly. Lucy didn’t care. She lifted the gtapey, dark red 
juice to her pa^ed mouth and drank. She fdt the sticky 
wetness between her thighs and pressed her legs together. 
Her body was trembling. Over the glass rim, as she drank, her 
eyes searched hungrily to find Sonny Corleone. There was no 
one else she cared to see. Slyly she whispered in Connie’s 
ear, ‘Only a few hours more and you’ll Imow what it’s all 
about.’ Connie giggled. Lucy demurely folded her hands on 
the table, treacherously triumphant, as if she had stolen a 
treasure from the bride. 

Amerigo Bonasera followed Hagen into the comer room.of 
the house and found Don Corleone sitting behind a huge desk. 
Sonny Corleone was standing by the window, lool^g out 
into the garden. For the first time that afternoon the Don 
behaved coolly. He did not embrace the visitor or shake 
hands. The sallow-faced undertaker owed his invitation to the 
fact that his wife and the wife of the Don were the closest of 
friends. Amerigo Bonasera himself was in severe disfavour 
with Don Corleone. 

Bonasera began his request obliquely and cleverly. ‘You 
must excuse my daughter, your wife’s goddaughter, for not 
doing your family the respect of coming today. She is in the 
hospital still.’ He glanced at Sonny Corleone^ and Tom 
Hagen to indicate that he did not wish to speak brforc them. 
But the Don was merciless. 

‘We all know of your daughter’s misfortune,’ Don Corleone 
said. ‘If I can help her in any way, you have only to speak. My 
wife is her godmother after all. 1 have never forgotten that 
honour.’ This was a rebuke. The undertaker never called Don 
Corleone ‘Godfather’ as custom dictated. 

Bonasera, ashen-fitced, asked, directly now, ‘May I speak to 
you alone?’ 


*7 



Don Corleone shook his head, *1 trust these two men with 
my life. They are my two tight arms. 1 cannot insult them by 
sending them away.’ 

The undertaker closed his eyes for a moment and then 
began to speak. His voice was quiet, the voice he used to con- 
sole the bereaved. raised my daughter in the American 
fashion. I believe in America. America has made my fortune. 
I gave my daughter her freedom and yet taught her never to 
dishonour her family. She found a “boyfriend”, not an 
Italian. She went to the movies with him. She stayed out late. 
But he never came to meet her parents. I accepted all this 
without a protest, the fault is mine. Two months ago he took 
her for a drive. He had a masculine friend with him. They 
made her drink whisky and then they tried to take advantage 
of her. She resisted. She kept her honour. They beat her. Like 
an animal. When I went to the hospital she had two black 
eyes. Her nose was broken. Her jaw was shattered. They had 
to wire it together. She wept through her pain. “Father, 
Father, why did they do it? Why did they do this to me?” 
And I wept.’ Bonasera could not speak further, he was weep- 
ing now though his voice had not betrayed his emotion. 

Den Corleone, as if against his will, made a gesture of 
sympathy and Bonasera went on, his voice human with 
suffering. ‘Why did I weep? She was the light of my life, an 
affectionate daughter. A beautiful girl. She tmsted people and 
now she will never trust them again. She will never be 
beautiful again.’ He was trembling, his sallow face flushed an 
ugly dark red. 

‘I went to the police like a good American. The two boys 
were arrested. They were brought to trial. The evidence was 
overwhelming and they pleaded guilty. The judge sentenced 
them to three years in prison and suspended the sentence. 
They went free that very day. I stood in the courtroom like a 
fool and those bastards smiled at me. And then 1 said to my 
wife: “We must go to Don Corleone for justice.’” 

Tlie Don had bowed his head to show respect for the man’s 
grief. But when he spdke, the words were cold with offended 
^gnity. ‘Why did you go to the police? Why didn’t you come 
to me at the beginning of this a£^?’ 

2S 



Bonasera muttered almost inaudibly, * What do you want of 
me? Tell me what you wish. But do what I beg you to do.* 
There was something almost insolent in his words, 

Don Corleonc said gravely, ‘And what is that?’ 

Bonasera glanced at Hagen and Sonny Corlcone and shook 
his head. The Don, still sitting at Hagen’s desk, inclined his 
body towards the undertaker. Bonasera hesitated, then bent 
down and put his lips so close to the Don’s hairy ear that they 
touched. Don Corlcone listened like a priest in the confes- 
sional, gazing away into the distance, impassive, remote. 
They stood so for a long moment until Bonasera finished 
whispering and straightened to his full height. The Don 
looked up gravely at Bonasera. Bonasera, his face Hushed, 
returned the stare unflinchingly. 

Finally the Don spoke. ‘That I cannot do. You are being 
carried away.’ 

Bonasera said loudly, clearly, ‘I will pay you anything you 
ask.* On hearing this, Hagen Hinched, a nervous flick of his 
head. Sonny Corlcone folded his arms, smiled sardonically as 
he turned from the window to watch the scene in the room for 
the first time. 

Don Corleone rose from behind the desk. His face was still 
impassive, but his voice rang like cold death. ‘ We have known 
each other many years, you and I,’ he said to the undertaker, 
‘but until this day you never came to me for coimsel or help. I 
can’t remember the last time you invited me to your house for 
coffee, though my wife is godmother to your only child. Let 
us be frank. You spurned my friendship. You feared to be in 
my debt.’ 

Bonasera murmured, ‘Ldidn’t want to get into trouble.* 

The Don held up his hand. ‘No. Don’t speak. You found 
America a paradise. You had a good trade, you made a good 
living, you thought the world a harmless place where you 
could take your pleasure as you willed. You never armed 
yourself with true friends. After all, the police guarded you, 
there were courts of law, you and yours could come to no 
harm. You did not need Don Corleone. Very well. My feelings 
were wounded, but I am not that sort of person who thrusts 
his friendship on those who do not value it - on those who 


*9 



thinlr me of little account/ The Don paused and gave the 
undertaker a polite, ironic smile. *Now you come to me and 
say, *^Don Corleone give me justice/* And you do not ask 
widi respect. You do not offer me your friendship. You come 
into my home on the bridal day of my daughter and you ask 
me to do murder and you say’ * here the Don’s voice became 
a scornful mimicry - will pay you anything/’ No, no, I 
am not offended, but what have I ever done to make you treat 
me so disrespectfully?’ 

Bonasera eded out in his anguish and his fear, 'America has 
been good to me. I wanted to be a good citizen. I wanted my 
child to be American.* 

The Don clapped his hands together with decisive approval. 
'Well spoken. Very fine. Then you have nothing to complain 
about. The judge has ruled. America has ruled. Bring your 
daughter flowers and a box of candy when you go visit her in 
the hospital. That will comfort her. Be content. After all, this 
is not a serious aflair, the boys were young, high-spirited, and 
one of them is the son of a powerful politician. No, my dear 
Amerigo, you have slwzys b^ honest. 1 must admit, though 
^ou spurned my friendship, that I would trust the given word 
of Amerigo Bonasera more than 1 would any other man’s. 
So give me your word that you will put aside this madness. 
It is not American. Forgive. Forget, life is full of mis- 
fortunes.’ 

The cruel and contemptuous irony with which all this was 
said, the controlled anger of the Don, reduced the poor under- 
taker to a quiveiing jelly, but he spoke up bravdy again. 'I 
ask you for justice.’ 

Don Corleone said curtly, 'The court gave you justice.* 

Bonasera 'Shook his head stubbornly. 'No. They gave the 
youths justice. They did not give me justice.* 

The Don acknowledged this fine dbtinedon with an 
approving nod, jdien ask^, 'What is your justice?’ 

'An eye for an eye,' Bonasera said. 

'You asked for more,* the Don said. 'Your daughter is 
alive.’ 

Bonasera said reluctantly, 'Let diem sufler as she suffers.* 
The Don waited for him to speak farther. Bonasera screwed 



up the last of his coufage and said, ^How much shall 1 pay 
you?’ It was a despairing wail. 

Don Corleone turned his back. It was a dismissal. Bonasera 
did not budge. 

Finally, sighing, a good-hearted man who cannot remain 
angry with an erring friend, Don Corleone turned back to the 
undertaker, who was now as pale as one of his corpses. Don 
Corleone was gentle, patient. ‘Why do you feat to give your 
first allegiance to me?’ he said. ‘You go to the law courts and 
wait for months. You spend money on lawyers who know full 
well you are to be made a fool of. You accept judgement from 
a judge whO' sells himself like the worst whore in the streets. 
Years gone by, when you needed money, you went to the 
banks and paid ruinous interest, waited hat in hand like a 
beggar while they sniffed aroimd, poked their noses up your 
very asshole to make sure you could pay them back.* The Don 
paused, his voice became sterner. 

‘But if you had come to me, my purse would have bec^ 
yours. If you had come to me for justice those scum who 
ruined your daughter would be weeping bitter tears this day. 
If by some misfortune an honest man like yourself made 
enemies they would become my enemies ’ - the Don raised his 
arm, finger pointing at Bonasera - ‘and then, believe me, they 
would fear you.’ 

Bonasera bowed his head and murmured in a strangled 
voice, ‘Be my friend. I accept.’ 

Don Corleone put his hand on the man’s shoulder. ‘Good,’ 
he said, ‘you shall have your justice. Some day, and that day 
may never come, 1 will call upon you to do me a service in 
return. Until that day, consider this justice a gift from my wife, 
your daughter’s godmother.’ 

When the door closed behind the grateful undertaker Don 
Corleone turned to Hagen and said, ‘Give this affair to 
Qemenza and tell him to be sure to use reliable people, people 
who will not be carried away by the smell of blood. After all, 
we’re not murderers, no matter what that corpse valet dreams 
up in his foolish head.* He noted that his first-bom, masculine 
son was gaaing through the window at the garden party. It 
was bopdess, Don Corleone thought. If he refused to be 



instructed, Santino could never run the family business, could 
never become 'a Don. He would have to find somebody else. 
And soon. After all, he was not immortal. 

From the garden, startling all three men, there came a happy 
roaring shout. Sonny Corleone pressed dose to the window. 
What he saw made him move quickly towards the door, a 
delighted smile on his face. *It’s Johnny, he came to the 
wedding, what did I tell you?* Hagen moved to the window, 
‘It’s really your godson,’ he said to Don CorlTOne. ‘Shall I 
bring him here?’ 

‘No,’ the Don said. ‘Let the people enjoy him. Let him 
come to me when he is ready.’ He smiled at Hagen. ‘You sec? 
He is a good godson.’ 

Hagen felt a twinge of jealousy. He said dryly, ‘It’s been 
twoyears. He’s probablyin trouble again and wants you to help.* 

‘And who should he come to if not his godfadier?’ asked 
Don Cotleone. 

The first one to see Johnny Fontaoe enter the garden was 
Connie Corleune. She forgot her bridal dignity and screamed, 
‘Johnece’. Then she ran into his arms. He hugged her tight 
and kissed her on the mouth, kept his arm around her as 
others came up to greet him. They were all ^s old friends, 
people he had grown up with on the West Side. Then Connie 
was dragging him to her new husband. Johnny saw with 
amusement that the blond young man looked a little sour at no 
longer being the star of the day. He turned on all his charm, 
shaking the groom’s hand, toasting him with a glass of wine. 

A familiar voice called from the bandstand, ‘How about 
giving us a song, Johnny?’ He looked up and saw Nino 
Valenti smiling down at him. Johnny Fontane jumped up on 
the bandstand and threw his arms around Nino. They had 
been inseparable, singing together, going out with girls 
together, until Johnny had started to become famous and 
sing on the radio. When he had gone to Hollywood to make 
movies Johnny had phoned Nino a couple of times just to talk 
and had promised to get him a club singing date. But he had 
never done so. Seeing Nino now, his cheerful, mocking, 
drunken grin, all the a&ction retumed. 


5 * 



Kino began stnunming on the mandolin. Johnny Fontane 
put his hand on Nino’s shoulder. ^This is for the btidc»’ he 
said, and stamping his foot, chanted the words to an obscene 
Sicilian love song. As he sang, Nino made suggestive motions 
with his body. The bride blushed proudly, the throng of 
guests roared its approval. Before the song ended they were 
ali stamping with their feet and roaring out the sly, double- 
meaning tag line that finished each stamca. At the end they 
would not stop applauding until Johnny cleared his throat to 
sing another song. 

They were all proud of him. He was of them and he had 
become a famous singer, a movie star who slept with the most 
desired women in the world. And yet he had shown proper 
respect for his Godfather by travelling three thousand ci^es to 
attend diis wedding. He still loved old friends like Nino 
Valenti. Many of the people there had seen Johrmy and Nino 
singing together when they were just boys, when no one 
dreamed that Johnny Fontane would grow up to hold the 
hearts of fifty million women in his hands. 

Johnny Fontane reached down and lifted the bride up on to 
the bandstand so that Connie stood between him and Nino. 
Both men crouched down, facing each other, Nino plucking 
the mandolin for a few harsh chords. It was an old routine of 
theirs, a mock battle and wooing, using their voices like 
swords, each shouting a chorus in turn. With the most delicate 
courtesy. Johnny let Nino’s voice overwhelm his own, let 
Nino take the bride from his arm, let Nino swing into the last 
victorious stanza while his own voice died away. The whole 
wedding party hrokeioto shouts of applause,the three of them em- 
braced each other at the end. The guests begged for another song. 

Only Don Corleone, standing in the corner entrance of the 
house, sensed something amiss. Cheerily, with bluff good 
humour, careful not to give ofience to his guests, he called 
out, ^My godson has come three thousand miles to do us 
honour and no one thinks to wet his throat?’ At once a dozen 
full wine glasses were thrust at Johnny Fontane. He took a sip 
from all and rushed to embrace his Godfisther. As he did so he 
whispered something into the older man’s ear. Don Corleone 
led hto into the house. 



Tom Hagca hdd out his band when Johnny came into the 
room. Johnny shook it and said, *How ate you, Tom?* But 
without his usual charm that consisted of a genuine warmth 
for people. Hagen was a litde hurt by this coolness, but 
shrugged it off. It was one of the penalties for being the Don’s 
hatchet man. 

Johnny Fontane said to the Don, * When 1 got the wedding 
invitation I said to myself, ^'My Godfather isn’t mad at me 
any more.” I called you five times after my divorce and Tom 
always told me you were out or busy, so I knew you were 
sore.’ 

Don Corleone was filling glasses from the yellow bottle of 
Strega. ^That’a all forgotten. Now. Can I do something for 
you still? You’re not too fismous, too rich, that 1 can’t help 
you?’ 

Johnny gulped down the yellow fiery liquid and held out his 
glass to be refilled. He tried to sound jaunty. *I’m not rich. 
Godfather. I’m going down. You were right. I should never 
have left my wife and kids for that tramp 1 married. 1 don’t 
blame you for gctdng sore at me.’ 

The Don shrugged. '1 worded about you, you’re my 
godson, that’s all.’ 

Johnny paced up and down the room. was crazy about 
that bitch. The biggest star in HoUywood. She looks like an 
angel. And you know what she does after a picture? If the 
make-up man does a good job on her face she lets him bang 
her. If the cameraman made her look extra good she brings 
him into her dressing room and gives him a screw. Anybody. 
She uses her body like 1 use the loose change m my pocket for 
a dp. A whore made for the devil.’ 

Don' Corleone curtly broke in. *How is your family?’ 

Johnny sighed. took care of them. After the divorce 1 
gave Ginny and the kids more than the courts said I should. 1 
go see them once a week. 1 miss them. Sometimes I think I’m 
going crazy.’ He took another drink. !Now my second wife 
laughs at me. She can’t understand my being jealous. She calls 
me an old-fashioned guinea, she makes fi^ of my singing. 
Before 1 left I gave ^ a beating, but not in the fiioe 
because she was making a picture. I gave her ciamps, 1 


54 



punched her on the arms and legs like a kid and she kept 
laughing at me.* He lit a cigarette. * So, Godfather, right now, 
life doe8n*t seem worth living.* 

Don Corleone said simply, ^These are troubles 1 can’t help 
you with.* He paused, then asked, ’What’s the matter ^trith 
your voice?* 

All the assured charm, the self-mockery, disappeared from 
Johnny Fontane’s face. He said almost brokenly, ’God&ther, 
I can’t sing any more, something happened to my throat, the^ 
doctors don’t know what.* Hagen and the Don leaked at him 
with surprise, Johnny had always been so tough. Fontane went 
on. ’My two pictures made a lot of money. I was a big star. 
Now they throw me out. The head of the studio always hated 
my guts, and now he’s paying mt off.* 

Don Corleone s^pod b^re his godson and asked grimly, 
’Why doesn’t this man like you?’ 

’I used to sing those songs for the liberal organkadons, you 
know, all that stuff you never liked me to do. Well, jiudk 
Waltz didn’t like it either. He called me a Communist, but he 
couldn’t make it sddr. Then I snatched a gkl he had saved for 
himself. It was stdedy a one-night stand and she came after 
me. What the hell could 1 do? Then my whore second wife 
throws me out. And Ginny and the kids won’t take me back 
unless 1 come ctawUng on my hands and knees, and I can’t 
sing any mote. God&ther, what the hell can 1 do?’ 

Don Gorleone’s fece had become cold without a hint of 
sympathy. He said contemptuously, ’You can start by acting 
like a man.’ Suddenly anger contorted his fece. He shouted. 
’LtKB A manI’ He reached over the desk and grabbed Johnny 
Fontane by the hair of his head in a gesture that was savagely 
affectionate. ’By Christ in heaven, is it possible that you spent 
so much time in presence and tuti^ out no better than 
this? A Holl 3 rwood finoetUo who weeps and begs for pity? 
Who cries out like a woman - ”Wbat shall I do? Oh, what 
shall I do?”’ 

The mimkxy of the Don was so extraordinary, so unex- 
pected, diat Hagen and Johnny were startled into laughter. 
Don Corleone was plea^. For a moment he reflected on 
how mudi he loved this godson. How would his own three 



sons have reacted to such a tongue-lashing? Sandno would 
have sulked and behaved badly for weeks afterwards. Fredo 
would have been cowed. Michael would have given him a cold 
smile and gone out of the house, not to be seen for months. 
But Johnny, ah, what a £ne chap he was, stniHng now, 
gathering strength, knowing already the true purpose of his 
Godfather. 

Don Corleone went on. ‘You took the woman of your boss, 
a man more powerful than yourself, then you complain he 
won’t help you. What nonsense. You left your family, your 
children without a fatlicr, to marry a whore and you weep 
because they don’t welcome you back with open arms. The 
whore, you don’t hit her in the face because she is making a 
picture, then you are ainaaed because she laughs at you. You 
lived Like a fool and you have come to a fool’s end.* 

Don Corleone paused to ask in a patient voice, ‘Are you 
willing to take my advice this time?’ 

Johnny Fontane shrugged. ‘I can’t marry Ginny again, not 
the way she wants. I have to gamble, 1 have to drink, I have to 
go out with the boys. Beautiful broads run after me and 1 
never could resist them. Then I used to feel like a heel when I 
went back to Ginny. Christ, 1 can’t go through all that crap 
again.’ 

It was rare that Don Corleone showed exasperation. ‘I 
didn’t tell you to get married again. Do what you want. It’s 
good you wish to be a ftther to your children. A man who is 
not a fttlicr to his children can never be a real man. But then, 
you must make their mother accept you. Who says you can’t 
see them every day? Who says you can’t live in the same 
house? Who says you can’t live your life exactly as you want to 
live it?* 

Johnny Fontane laughed. ‘Godfather, not all women arc 
like the old Italian wives. Ginny won’t stand for it.’ 

Now the Don was mocking. ‘Because you acted like a 
fifwcMe, You gave her more than the court said. You didn’t hit 
the other in the fice because she was making a picture. You 
let women dictate your actions and they are not competent in 
this world, though certainly they will be saints in heaven while 
we men bum in hell. And then I’ve watched you all these 



years.’ The Don’s voice bec^e earnest. * You’ve been a fine 
godson, you’ve given me all the respect. But what of your 
other old friends? One year you run around with this person, 
the next year with another person. That Italian boy who was so 
funny in the movies, he had some bad luck and you never saw 
him again because you were more famous. And how about 
your old, old comrade that you went to sdiool with, who was 
your partner singing? Nino. He drinks too much out of dis- 
appointment, but he never complains. He works hard driving 
the gravel truck and sings weekends for a few JoUars. He 
never says anything against you. You couldn’t help him a bit? 
Why not? He sings well.’ 

Johnny Fontane said with patient weariness, ‘Godfather, he 
just hasn’t got enough talent. He’s OK, but he’s not big 
time.’ 

Don Corlepne lidded his eyes almost closed and then said, 
‘And you, godson, you now, you just don’t have talent 
enough. ShaitI get you a job on the gravel truck with Nino?’ 
When Johnny didn’t answer, the Don went on. ‘Friendship is 
everything. Friendship is more than talent. It is mote than 
government. It is almost the equal of family. Never forget 
that. If you had built up a wall of friendships you wouldn’t 
have to ask me to help. Now tell me, why can’t you sing? You 
sang well in the garden. As well as Nino.’ 

Hagen and Johnny smiled at this delicate thrust. It was 
Johnny’s turn to be patronizingiy patient. ‘My voice is weak. 
I sing one or two songs and then I can’t sing again for hours or 
days. I can’t make it ^ough the rehearsals or the retakes. My 
voice is weak, it’s got some sort of sickdess.’ 

‘So you have woman trouble. Your voice is sick. Now tell 
me the trouble you’re having with this HoMj^ood 
who won’t let you work.’ The Don was getting down to 
business. 

‘He’s bigger than one of yom pei(;(pnopa 9 ti* Johnny said. 
‘He owns tibe studio. He advises the President on movie 
propaganda for the war. Just a month ago he bought the 
movie rights to the biggest novel of the year. A bestseller. 
And the main character is a guy just like me. 1 wouldn’t even 
have to act, just be myself. 1 w^dn’t even have to sing. 1 


57 



might even win the Academy Award. Everybody knows' it's 
p^ect for me and I^d be big again. As an actor. But that 
bastard Jack Wolta is paying me off, he won^t give it to me. 1 
ofiered to do it for nothing, for a minimi iin ptice onH be 
says no. He sent the word t^t if I come and kiss his ass in the 
studio commissary, maybe he’ll think about it.’ 

Don Corleone dismissed this emotional nonsense with a 
wave of his hand. Among reasonable men problems of 
business could always be solved. He patted his godson on the 
shoulder. * You’re discouraged. Nobody cares about you, so 
you think. And you’ve lost a lot of weight. You drink a lot, 
eh? You don’t sleep and you take pills?’ He shook his head 
disapprovingly. 

‘ Now I want you to follow my orders,’- the Don said. *I want 
you to stay in my house for one month. I want you to eat well, 
to^rest and sleep. I want you to be my companion, I enjoy 
your company, and maybe you can learn something about the 
world from your Godfather that might even help you in the 
great Hollywood. But no singing, no drinking, and no 
women. At the end of the month you can go back to Holly- 
wood and this calibre will give you that 

job you want. Done?’ 

Johnny Fontane could not altogether believe that the Don 
had such power. But his Godfather had never said such and 
such a thing could be done without having it done. ’This guy 
is a persond friend of J. Edgar Hoover,’ Johnny said. ^You 
can’t even raise your voice to him.’ 

‘He’s a businessman,’ the Don said blandly. ‘I’ll make him 
an offer he can’t refuse.’ 

‘It’s too late,’ Johnny said. ‘All the contracts have been 
signed^ and they start shooting in a week. It’s absolutely im- 
possible.’ 

Don Corleone said, ‘Go, go back to the party. Your friends 
are waiting for you. Leave everything to me.’ He pushed 
Johnny Fontane out of the room. 

Hagen sat behind the desk and made notes. The Don heaved 
a sigh and asked, ‘Is there anything else?’ 

‘Sollozzo can’t be put off any mote. You’U have to see him 
this week.’ Hagen held his pen over die calendar. 

58 



The Don shragged. *Now that the wedding k over* when- 
ever you like.’ 

This answer told Hagen two things. Most important, that 
the answer to Virgil Sollozao would be no. The second, that 
Don Corleone, since he would not give the answer before his 
daughter’s wedding, expected his no to cause trouble. 

Hagen said cautiously, * Shall 1 tell Qemen^a to have some 
men come live in the house?’ 

The Don said impatiently, ^For what? 1 didn’t answer 
before the wedding because on an important day like that 
there should be no cloud, not even in the distance. Also 1 
wanted to know beforehand what he wanted to talk about. 
We know now. What he will propose is an infamita* 

Hagen asked, ‘Then you will refuse?’ When the Don 
nodded, Hagen said, ‘I think we should all discuss it - die 
whole Family - before you give your answer.’ 

The Don smiled. ‘You think so? Good, we will discuss it. 
When you come back from Gdifomia. 1 want you to fly diere 
tomorrow and settle this business for Johnny. See that movie 
Tell S 0 II 0220 1 will see him when you get badt 
from California. Is there anything else?’ 

Hagen said formally, ‘The hospital called. 
Abbandando is dying, he won’t last out the night. His fiunily 
was told to come and wait.’ 

Hagen had filled the ConstgliotrV% post for the past year, ever 
since the cancer had imprisoned Genco Abbandando in his 
hospital bed. Now be waited to hear Don Corleone say the 
post was his permanently. The odds were against it. So high a 
position was traditionally given only to a man descended from 
two Italian parents. There had alre^y been trouble about his 
temporary performance of the duties. Also, lie was cmly 
thirty-five, not old enough, ^pposedly, to have acquired the 
necessary experience and cunning for a successful Oms^fiori. 

But the Don gave him no encouragement. He asked, ‘When 
does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?’ 

Hagen looked at his wristwatch. ‘In a few minutes tiieyHl 
cut ^ cake and then a harbour after that.’ That reminded 
him of something else. ‘Your new son-in-law. Do we give 
him something important, inside die Family?’ 



He was surprised at the vehemence of the Don^s answer. 
‘Never.* The Don hit the desk with the flat of his hand. 
‘Never. Give him something to earn his living, a good 
living. But never let him know the Family’s business. Tdl the 
others. Sonny, Frcdo, Qemen:sa.’ 

The Don paused. * Instruct my sons, all three of them, that 
they will accompany me to the hospit^ to see poor Genco. I 
want them to pay their last respects. Tell Freddie to drive the 
big car and ask Johnny if he will come with us, as a special 
favour to me.’ He saw Hagen look at him questioningly. ‘I 
want you to go to Califomia tonight. You won’t have time to 
go see Genco. But don’t leave until I come back from the 
hospital and speak with you. Under's tood ? * 

‘ Understood,’ Hagen said. * What time should Fred have the 
car waiting?’ 

* When the guests have left/ Don Corleone said. ‘Genco will 
wait for me.’ 

‘The Senator called,’ Hagen said. ‘Apologizing for not 
coming personally but that you would understand. He 
probably means these two FBI men across the street taking 
down licence numbers. But he sent his gift over by special 
messenger.’ 

The Don nodded. He did not think it necessary to mention 
that he himself had warned the Senator not to come. ‘Did he 
send a nice present?’ 

Hagen made a face of impressed approval that was very 
strangely Italian on his German-Irish features. ‘Antique 
silver, very valuable. The kids can sell it for a grand at least. 
The Senator spent a lot of time getting exactly the right thing. 
For those kind of people that’s more important than how 
much it costs.’ 

Don Corleohe did not hide his pleasure that so great a man 
as the Senator had shown him such respect. The Senator, like 
Luca Brasi, was one of the great stones in the Don's power 
structure, and he too, with this gift, had reswom his 
loyalty. 

When Johnny Fontane appeared in the garden Kay Adams 
recognized him immediately. She was truly surprise. ‘You 


40 



never told me your fimiily knew Johnny Fontane,’ she said. 
‘Now I’m sure I’ll marry you.’ 

‘Do you want to meet him?* Michael asked. 

‘Not now/ Kay said. She sighed. ‘I was in love with him 
for three years. I used lo come down to New York whenever 
he sang at the Capitol and scream my head o£F. He was so 
wonderful.* 

‘We’ll meet him later/ Michael said. 

When Johnny finished singing and vanished into the house 
with Don Corlcone, Kay said archly to Michael, ‘Don’t tell 
me a big movie star like Johnny Fontane has to ask your 
father for a favour?’ 

‘He’s my father’s godson/ Michael said. ‘And if it wasn’t 
for my father he might not be a big movie star today.’ 

Kay Adams laughed with delight. ‘That sounds like another 
great story.’ 

Michael shook his head. ‘I can’t teU that one/ he said. 

‘Trust me,’ she said. 

He told her. He told her without being funny. He told it 
without pride. He told it without any sort of explanation 
except that eight years before his father had been more 
impetuous, and because the matter concerned his godson, 
the Don considered it an afiair of personal honour. 

The story was quickly told. Eight years ago Johnny Fontane 
had made an extraordinary success singing with a popular 
dance band. He had become a top radio attraction. Unfor- 
tunately the band leader, a well-known show business per- 
sonality named Les Halley, had signed Johnny to a five-year 
persoi^ services contract. It was a common show-business 
practice. Les Halley could now loan Johnny out and pocket 
most of the money. 

Don Codeone entered the negotiations personally. He 
ofiered Les Halley twenty thousand dollars to release Johnny 
Fontane horn the personal services contract. Halley o^ered to 
take only fifty per cent of Johnny’s earnings. Don Corlcone 
was amused. He dropped his offer from twenty thousand 
doUars to ten thousand dollars. The band leader, obviously 
not a man of the world outside his beloved show business, com- 
tdetely missed the -significance of this lower ofier. He rdfused. 


41 



The next day Don Cotleone went to see the band leader 
personally. He brought with him his two best friends, 
Genco Abbandando, who was his Consigliori^ and Luca Brasi. 
With no other witnesses Don Corleone persuaded Les Halley 
to sign a document giving up all rights to all services from 
Johnny Fontane upon payment of a certified cheque to the 
amount of ten thousand dollars. Don Corleone did this by 
putting a pistol to the forehead of the band leader and assuring 
him with the utmost seriousness that either his signature or his 
brains would rest on that document in exactly one minute. 
Les Halley signed. Don Corleone pocketed his pistol and 
handed over the certified cheque. 

The rest was history. Johnny Fontane went on to become 
the greatest singing sensation in the country. He made Holly- 
wood musicals that earned a fortune for his studio. His 
records made millions of dollars. Then he divorced his child- 
hood-sweetheart wife and lefr his two children, to marry the 
most glamorous blonde star in motion pictures. He soon 
learned that she was a ‘whore*. He drank, he gambled, he 
chased other women. He lost his singing voice. His records 
stopped selling. The studio did not renew his contract. And 
so now he had come back to his Godfrther. 

Kay said thoughtfully, ‘Are you sure you’re not jealous of 
your father? Everything you’ve told me about him shows him 
doing something for other people. He must be good-hearted.’ 
She smiled wryly. ‘Of course his methods are not exactly 
constitutional.’ 

Michael sighed. *I guess that’s the way it sounds, but let me 
tell you this. You Imow those Arctic explorers who leave 
caches of food scattered on the route to the North Pole? 
Just in case they may need diem some day? That’s my 
father’s frvours. Some day he’ll be at each one of those 
people’s houses and diey had better come across.’ 

It was nearly twilight before the wedding cake was shown, 
exclaimed over, and eaten. Specially baked by Nazorine, it was 
deverly decorated with shells of cream so dizzyingly ddidous 
diat die bdde greedily plucked them from the corpse of the 
cake befi^re she whiwied away on her honeymoon with her 
blond groom. The Don policy sped his* guests’ dqsartore.

nodng meanwhile that the black sedan with its FBI men was 
no longer visible. 

Finally, the only car left in the driveway was the long black 
Cadillac with Freddie at the wheeL^The Don got into the front 
seat, moving with quick coordination for his age and bulk. 
Sonny, Michael, and Johnny Fontane got into the back seat. 
Don Corleone said to his son Michael, ‘Your girlfriend, she’ll 
get back to the city by herself all right?’ 

Michael nodded. ‘Tom said he’d take care of it.’ Don 
(^rleone nodded with satisfaction at Hagen’s efficiency. 

Because of the gas rationing still in efiect, there was little 
traffic on the Belt Parkway to Manhattan. In less than an hour 
the Cadillac rolled into the street of French Hospital. During 
the ride Don Corleone asked his youngest son if he was doing 
well in school. Michael nodded. Then Sonny in the back scat 
asked his father, ‘Johnny says you’re getting him squared 
away with that Hollywood business. Do you want me to go 
out there and help?’ 

Don Corleone was curt. ‘Tom is going tonight. He won’t 
need any help, it’s a simple aftiir.’ 

Sonny Corleone laughed. ‘Johnny thinks you can’t fix it, 
that’s why 1 thought you might want me to go out there.’ 

Don Corleone turned his head. ‘Why do you doubt me?’ he 
asked Johnny Fontane. ‘Hasn’t your Godfrther always done 
what he said he would do? Have 1 ever been taken for afool?’ 

Johnny apologized nervously. ‘Godfather, the man who 
runs it is a .90 calibre pa^nmf€mt 9 . You can’t budge him, 

not even with money. He has big connexions. And he hates 
me. 1 just don’t know how you can swing it.’ 

The Don spoke with affectionate amusement. ‘1 say to you: 
you shall have it.’ He nudged Michael with his elbow. ‘We 
won’t disappoint my godson, eh, Michael?’ 

Michael, who never doubted his &ther for a moment, shook 
his head. 

As they walked towards the hospital entrance, Don Cor- 
leone put his hand on Michael’s arm so that the o^ers forged 
ahead. ‘When you get through with college, come and talk to 
me,’ the Don said. ‘1 have some plans you will like.’ 

Michael didn’t say anything. Don Corleone grunted in 


45 



exasperation. know how you ate. 1 won’t ask you to do 
anything you don’t approve of. This is something special. Go 
your own way now, you’re a man after all. But come to me as a 
son should when you have finished with your schooling.’ 

The family of Gcnco Abbandando, wife and three daughters 
dressed in black, clustered like a flock of plump crows on the 
white tile floor of tlie hospital corridor. When they saw Don 
Corleone come out of the elevatoi they seemed to flutter up 
off the white tiles in an instinctive surge towards him for 
protection. The mother was regally stout in black, the 
daughters fat and plain. Mrs Abbandando pecked at Don 
Corleone’s cheek, sobbing, wailing, ‘ Oh, what a saint you arc, 
to come here on your daughter’s wedding day.* 

Don Corleone brushed these thanks aside. ‘Don’t I owe 
respect to such a friend, a friend who has been my right arm 
for twenty years?’ He had understood immediately that the 
soon-to-be widow did not comprehend that her husband 
would die this night. Genco Abbandando had been in this 
hospital for nearly a year dying of his cancer and the wife had 
come to consider his fatal illness almost an ordinary part of 
life. Tonight was just another crisis. She babbled on. ‘Go in 
and see my poor husband,’ she said, ‘he asks for you. Poor, 
man, he wanted to come to the wedding to show his respect, 
but the doctor would not permit it. Then he said you would 
come to see him on this great day, but I did not believe it 
possible. Ah, men understand friendship more than we 
women. Go inside, you will make him happy.’ 

A nurse and a doctor came out of Genco Abbandando’s 
private room. The doctor was a young man, serious-faced and 
with the air of one born to command, that is to say, the air of 
one who has been immensely rich all his life. One of the 
daughters asked timidly, ‘ Dr Kennedy, can we go to see him 
now?’ 

Dr Kennedy looked over the large group with exasperation. 
Didn’t these people rcalixe that the man inside was dying 
and dying in torturous pain? It would be much better if every- 
one let him die in peace. ‘I think just the immediate family/ 
he said in his exquisitely polite voice. He was surprised 



when the wife and daughters turned to the short, heavy man 
dressed in an awkwardly £tted tuxedo, as if to hear his 
decision. * 

The heavy man spoke. There was just the slightest trace of 
an Italian accent in his voice. "My dear doaor,’ said Don 
Corleone, " is it true he is dying? ’ 

"Yes/ said Dt Kennedy. 

"Then there is nothing more for you to do/ said Don 
Corleone. "We will take up the burden. We wiD comfort him. 
We will dose his eyes. We will bury him and weep at his 
funeral and afterwards we will watch over his wife and 
daughters.’ At hearing things put so bluntly, forcing her to 
understand, Mrs Abbandando ^gan to weep. 

Dr Kennedy shrugged. It was impossible to explain to these 
peasants. At the same time he recognized the crude justice in 
the man’s remarks. His role was over. Still exquisitely polite, 
he said, "Please wait for the nurse to let you in, she has a few 
necessary things to do with the patient.’ He walked away from 
them down the corridor, his white coat flapping. 

The nurse went back into the room and they waited. Finally 
she came out again, holding the door for them to enter. She 
whispered, ‘He’s delirious with the pain and fever, try not to 
exdte him. And you can stay only a few minutes, except for the 
wife.’ She recognized Johnny Fontane as he went by her and 
her eyes opened wide. He gave her a faint smile of acknow- 
ledgement and she stared at him with frank invitation. He fled 
her away for future reference, then followed the others into 
the sick man’s room. 

Genco Abbandando had run a long race with death, and 
now, vanquished, he lay exhausted on the raised bed. He was 
wasted away to no more than a skdeton, and what had once 
been vigorous black hair had turned into obscene stringy 
wisps. Don Corleone said cheerily, "Genco, dear friend, I have 
brought my sons to pay their respects, and look, even Johnny 
all the way from Hollywood.’ 

The dying man raised his fevered eyes gratefully to the Don. 
He let the young men clasp his bony hand in their fleshy ones. 
His wife and daughters ranged themsdves along his bed, 
kissing his cheek, taking his other hand in turn. 


45 



The Don pressed his old fidend’s hincL He said comfort- 
ingly, *Hurry up and get better and well take a trip to Italy 
tog^et to our old village. We’ll play bom$ in frcmt of the 
wineshop like our fiithets before us.’ 

The dying man shook his head, fie motioned the young 
men and his fiunily away from his bedside; widi the other 
bony daw he hung fast to the Don. He tri^ to speak. The 
Don put his head down and then sat on the bedside chair. 
Genco Abbandando was babbling about their childhood. 
Then his coal-black eyes became sly. He whispered. The Don 
bent doser. The others in the room were astonished to see 
tears running down Don Corleone’s free as he shook his head. 
The quavering voice grew louder, filling the room. With a 
tortured, superhuman effort, Abbandando lifted his head off 
his pillow, eyes unseeing, and pointed a skeletal forefinger at 
the Don. ^Godfather, Godfather,’ he called out blindly, ’save 
me from death, 1 beg of you. I^y flesh is burning off my bones 
and 1 can fed the worms eating away my brain. Godfrther, 
cure me, you have the power, dry the tears of my poor wife. 
In Corleone we played together as children, and now wiU you 
let me die when 1 fear hell for my sins?’ 

The Don was silent. Abbandando said, ’It is your daughter’s 
wedding day, you cannot refuse me.’ 

The Don spoke quietly, gravdy, to pierce through the 
blasphemous delirium. ’Old friend,’ he said, ’1 have no such 
powers. If I did I would be more merciful than God, believe 
me. But don’t fear death and don’t fear hell. I will have a mass 
said for your soul every night and every morning. Your wife 
and your children will pray for you. How can God punish you 
with so many pleas for mercy?’ 

The skeleton face took on a cunning expression that was 
obscene. Abbandando said slyly, 'It’s been arranged then?’ 

When the Don answered, his voice was cold, without 
comfort. ’You blaspheme. Resign yourself.’ 

Abbandando fell back on the pillow. His eyes lost their wild 
gleam of hope. The nurse came back into the room and started 
shooing them out in a very matter-of-fret way. The Don got 
up, but Abbandando put out his hand. ’GoeflEsther,’ he said, 
’stay here with me and help me meet death. Perhaps if He sees 

46 



you neair me He vnU be filghteiied and leave me in peace. Or 
perhaps you can say a word, puU a few strings, eh?* The 
dying man winked as if he were mocking the Don, now not 
really serious. ^You’re brothers in blood, after all.’ Iben, as if 
feadng the Don would be offended, he clutched at his hand. 
*Stay with me, let me hold your hand. We’ll outwit that 
bastard as we’ve outwitted others. Godfether, don’t betray me.* 

The Don motioned the other people out of the room. They 
left. He took the withered claw of Genco Abbandando in his 
own two broad hands. Softly, reassuringly, he comforted his 
friend, as they waited for deadi together. As if the Don could 
truly snatch the life, of Genco Abbandando back from that 
most foul and criminal traitor to man. 

The wedding day of Connie Corleone ended well for her. 
Carlo Bjzsd performed his duties as a bridegroom with skill 
and vigour, spurred on by the contents of the bride’s gift purse 
which totall^ up to over twenty thousand dolbrs. The 
bride, however, gave up her virginity^ with a great deal more 
willingness than she gave up her purse. For the latter, he had 
to blacken one of her eyes. 

Lucy Mancini waited in her house for a call from Sonny 
Corleone, sure that he would ask her for a date. Finally she 
called his house and whenshe heard a woman’s voice answer the 
phoneshehungup. Shehadno way ofknowing that nearly every- 
one at the wedding had remarked the absence of her and Sonny 
for that fatal half hour and the gossip was already spreading 
that Santino Corleone had found another victim. That he 
had Mone the job’ on his own sister’s maid of honour. 

Amerigo Donasera had a terrible nightmare. In his dreams 
he saw Don Corleone, in peaked cap, overalls,’and heavy 
gloves, unloading bullet-riddled corpses in front of his funeral 
parlour and shouting, * Remember, Amerigo, not a word to 
anyone, and bury them quickly.’ He groaned so loudandlong in 
his sleep that his wife shook him awake. *Eh, what a man you 
are,’ she grumbled. * To have a nightmare only after a wedding. ’ 

Kay Adams was escorted to her New York City hotel by 
PauUe Gatto and Qdnenaa. The car was large, luxurious, and 
driven by Gatto. Qemenza sat in the back seat and Kay was 


47 



gived the front seat next to the ddver. She found both men 
wildly exotic. Their speech ^was movie Brooklynese and they 
treated her with exaggerated courtliness. Duri^ the ride she 
chatted casually with both men and was surprised when they 
spoke of Michael with unmistakable a£Fection and tespect. He 
had led het to believe* that he was an alien in his fafoer*s 
world. Now Clemenxa was assuring her in his wheeaing 
guttural voice that the ‘old man* thought Mike was the best of 
his sons, the one who would surely inherit the fiimily business. 

‘ What business is that ? ’ Kay asked in the most natural way. 

Paulie Gatto gave hei* a quick glance as he turned the 
wheel. Behind her Qemenza said in a surprised voice. ‘Dida*t 
Mike tell you? Mr Q>rleone is the biggest importer of Italian 
olive oil in the States. Now that the war is over the business 
could get real rich. He*ll need a smart boy like Mike.’ 

At the hotel Clemenxa insisted on coming to the desk with 
het. When she protested, he said simply, ‘The boss said to 
make sure you got home OK. I gotta do it.* 

After she received her room key he walked her to the 
elevator and waited until she got in. She waved to him, 
smiling, and was surprised at his genuine smile of pleasure in 
return. It was just as well she did not see him go iMck to the 
hotel clerk and ask, ‘ What name she registered under?* 

Tlic hotel clerk looked at Qemenza coldly. Qemenza rolled 
the little green spitball he was holding in his hand across to the 
clerk, who picked it up and immediately said, ‘Mr and Mrs 
Michael Corleone.* 

Back in the car, Paulie Gatto said, ‘Nice dame.* 

Qemenza grunted. ‘ Mike is doing the job on her.’ Unless, 
he thought, they were really married. ‘Pick me up early in the 
morning,* he told Paulie. G^tto. ‘Hagen got some deal for us 
that gotta be done tight away.’ 

It was late Sunday night before Tom Hagen could kiss his 
wife goodbye and drive out to the airport. With his special 
number one priority (a grateful gift ftom a Pentagon staff 
general ofHcer) he no trouble getting on a plane to Los 
Angeles. 

It had been a busy but satisfying day for Tom Hagen. Genco 

48 



AbbaddAndo had died at three in the morning and when Don 
Corleonc returned from the hospital, he had informed Hagen 
that he wsa now officially the new ConsigHm to the fitmily. 
This meant that Hagen was sure to become a very xidi man, to 
say nothing of power* 

The Don had broken a long-standing ttadition. The 
Consiglim was always a full-blooded Sicilian, and the fact that 
Hagen had been brought up as a member of the Don’s family 
made no difierence to that tradition. It was a question of blood- 
Only a Sicilian bom to the ways of omerta^ the law of silence, 
could be trusted in the key post of Consigliori. 

Between the head of the fiunily, Don G>rleone, who dic- 
tated policy, and the operating krel of men who actually 
carried out ^e orders of the Don, there were three layers, or 
bufiers. In that way nothing could be traced to the top. Unless 
the Consigli&ri turned traitor. That Sunday morning Don 
Corleone gave explicit instructions on what should be done to 
the two young men who hsul beaten the daughter of Amerigo 
Bonasera. But he had given those orders in private to Tom 
Hagen. Later in the day Hagen had, also in private without 
witnesses, instructed Oemenaa. In turn Oememai had told 
Paulie Gatto to execute the commission. Paulie Gatto would 
now muster the necessary manpower and execute the orders. 
Paulie Gatto and his men would not know why this particular 
task was being carried out or who had ordered it originally. 
Each link of the chain would have to turn traitor for the Don 
to be involved and though it had never yet happened, there 
was always the possibility. The cure for that possibility also 
was known. Only one link in the chain had to ^sappear. 

The Cmmgiiori was also what his name implied. JFie was the 
counsellor to the Don, his right-hand man, his aui^iary brain. 
He was also hiS closest companion and his closest friend. On 
important trips he would drive the Don’s car, at conferences 
he would go out and get the Don refreshments, codec and 
sandwiches, fresh cigars. He would know everything the Don 
knew or nearly everything, all the cells of power. He was the 
one man in the world who could bring the Don crashing down 
to destruction. But no CMsigfim had ever betrayed a Don, not 
in the memory of any of the powerful Sicilian fisimilies who had 


49 



estibliilied tfaemtelyes in Afnedcm. Tl^ 

And every CmuigUm knew that if he kept the 6ddi, be would 
become licfa, wkdd power, and win reipect. If miifortune 
came, his wife and children would be sheltered and cared £6t 
as if ^ were alhre or free. I/Jk kgpt /fe ftM. 

In some matters die Cmsigfhri had to act for his Don in a 
more open way and yet not involve his principal. Hagen was 
flying to Qdifotnia on just such a matter. He realhsed that his 
career as Cmmglkri woidd be seriously affxted by the success 
or feihire of this mission. By femily business standards whether 
Johnny Fontane got his coveted part in the war movie^ or did 
no^ was a minor matter. Far more important was the meeting 
Hagen had set- up with Virgil SoUosbeo the following Friday. 
But Hagen knew that to the Don, both were of equal impor- 
tance, which setded the matter for any good Consig^ori. 

The piston plane shook Tom Hagen’s already nervous in- 
sides and he ordered a martini from the hostess to quiet them. 
Both the Don and Johnny had briefed him on die character of 
the movie producer. Jack Wdka. From everything that Johnny 
said, Hagen knew he would never be able to persuade Wolta. 
But he also had no doubt whatsoever that the Don would keep 
his promise to Johnny; His own role was that of negotiator 
and contact. 

Lying back in his seat, Hagen went over all the information 
given to him that day. Jack Woita was one of the three most 
important movie producecs in Hollywood, owner of his own 
studio with doaens of stars under conttact. He wis on the 
President of the United States* Advisory Council for War 
Information, Cinematic Division, which meant simply that he 
helped make propaganda movie^ He had had dinner at the 
White flouse. He had entertained J. Edgar Hoover in his 
Hollywood home. But none of this was as impressive as it 
sounded. They were all oflSdal relationships. Woltz didn’thave 
any personal political power, mainly because he was an 
extreme reactionary, pa^y because he was a m^alomaniac 
who loved to wield power wildly without regard to the feet 
that by so doing legions of enmics sprang up out of the 
ground. 

Hagen sighed. There would be no way to * handle’ Jadt 

JO 



Wolt2. He opened his briefcase and tried to get some paper 
work done, but he was too tired. He ordered another martini 
and reflected on his life. He had no regrets, indeed he felt that 
he had been extremely lucky. Whatever the reason, the course 
he had chosen ten years ago had proved to be right for him. 
He was successful, he was as happy as any grown man could 
reasonably expect, and he found life interesting. 

Tom Hagen was thirty-five years old, a tall crew-cut man, 
very slender, very ordinary-looking. He was a lawyer but did 
not do the actual detailed legal work for the Corleone family 
business though he had practised law for three years after 
passing the bar exsm. 

At the age of eleven he had been a playmate of eleven-year 
old Sonny Corleone. Hagen’s mother had gone blind and then 
died during his eleventh year. Hagen’s father, a heavy drinker, 
had become a hopeless drunkard. A hard-working carpenter, 
he had never done a dishonest thing in his life. But his drinking 
destroyed his family and finally killed him. Tom Hagen was 
left an orphan who wandered the streets and slept in hallways. 
His younger sister had been put in a foster home, but in the 
1 920s the social agencies did not follow up cases of twelve- 
year-old boys who were so ungrateful as to run from their 
charity. Hagen, too, had an eye infection. Neighbours whis- 
pered that he had caught or inherited it from his mother and so 
therefore it could be caught from him. He was shunned. Sonny 
Corleone, a warmhearted and imperious eleven-year-old, had 
brought his friend home and demanded that he be taken in. 
Tom Hagen was given a hot dish of spaghetti with oily rich 
tomato sauce, the taste of which he had never forgotten, and 
then given a metal folding bed to sleep on. « 

In the most natural way, without a word being spoken or 
the matter discussed in any feshion, Don Corleone had per- 
mitted the boy to stay in his household. Don Corleone himself 
took the boy to a special doctor and had his eye infection 
cured. He sent him to college and law school. In all this the 
Don acted not as a father but rather as a guardian. There was 
no show of afiection but oddly enough the Don treated Hagen 
more courteously than his own sons, did not impose a parental 
will upon him. It was the boy’s decision to go tp law school 





after college. He bad heard Don G>rleoiie say once, lawyer 
with his briefcase can steal more than a hundred men with 
guns.’ Meanwhile, much to the annoyance of their father. 
Sonny and Freddie insisted on going into the family business 
after graduation from high school. Only Michael had gone on 
to college, and he had enlisted in the Marines the day after 
Pearl Harbor. 

After he passed the bar eaatn, Hagen married to start his 
own family. The bride was a young Italian girl from New 
Jersey, rare at that time for being a college graduate. After the 
wedding, which was of course held in the home of Don 
Corlcone, the Don offered to support Hagen in any under- 
taking he desired, to send him law clients, furnish his oftice, 
start him in real estate. 

Tom Hagen had bowed his head and said to the Don, ’I 
would like to work for you.’ 

The Don was surprised, yet pleased. ‘You know who I am? ’ 
he asked. 

Hagen nodded. He hadn’t really known the extent of the 
Don’s power, not then. He did not really know m the ten 
years that followed until he was made the acting Consiguori 
after Genco Abbandando became ill. But he nodded and met 
the Don’s eyes with his own. ‘I would work for you like your 
sons,’ Hagen said, meaning with complete loyalty, with com- 
plete acceptance of the Don’s parental divinity. The Don, with 
that understanding which was even then building the legend 
of his greatness, showed the young man the first mark ofr 
fstherly affection since he had come into his household. He 
took Hagen into his arms for a quick embrace and afterwards 
treated him more like a true son, though he would sometimes 
say, ‘Tbm, never forget your parents,’ as if he were reminding 
himself as well as Hagen. 

There was no chance that Hagen would forget. His mother 
had been near moronic and slovenly, so ridden by anaemia she 
could not feel affection for her children or make a pretence of 
it. His father Hagen had hated. His mother’s blindness before 
she died had terriff ed him and his own eye infection had been a 
stroke of doom. He had been sure he would go blind. When 
his father died, Tom Hagen’s eleven-year-old mind had 


54 



snapped in a curious way. He had roamed the streets like an 
animal waiting for death until the fateful day Sonny found him 
sleeping in the back of a hallway and brought him to his home. 
What had happened afterwards was a miracle. But for years 
Hagen had had nightmares, dreaming he had grown to man- 
hood blind, tapping a white cane, his blind children behind 
him tap-tapping with their little white canes as they begged in 
the streets. Some mornings when he woke the face of Don 
Q>rlcone was imprinted on his brain in that first conscious 
moment and he would feel safe. 

But the Don had insisted that he put in three years of general 
law practice in addition to his duties for the family business. 
This experience had proved invaluable later on, and also re- 
moved any doubts in Hagen’s mind about working for Don 
Corleone. He had then spent two years of training in the offices 
of a top firm of criminal law'yers in which the Don had some 
influence. It was apparent to everyone that he had a flair for 
this branch of the law. He did well and when be went into the 
full-time service of the family business, Don Corleone had not 
been able to reproach him once in the six years that followed. 

When he had been made the acting Consigliori, the other 
powerful Sicilian families referred contemptuously to the Cor- 
leone family as the * Irish gang’. This had amused Hagen. It 
had also taught him that he could never hope to succeed the 
Don as the head of the fiunily business. But he was content. 
That had never been his goal, such an ambition would have 
been a 'disrespect’ to his benefiictor and his benefactor’s 
blood family. 

It was still dark when the plane landed in Loa Angeles. 
Hagen checked into his hotel, showered and shaved, and 
watclied dawn come over the dty. He ordered breakfast and 
newspapers to be sent up to his room and relaxed undl it was 
time for his ten am appointment with Jack Woltz. The ap- 
pointment had been surprisingly easy to make. 

The day before, Hagen had c^ed the most powerful man in 
the movie labour unions, a man named Billy Gofl. Acting on 
instructions from Don Corleone, Hagen had told Go£F to 
arrange an appointment on the next day for Hagen to call on 


55 



Jack Woltz, that he should hint to Woltz diat if Hagen was not 
made happy by the results of the interview, there could be a 
labour strike at the movie studio. An hour later Hagen re- 
ceived a call from Goff. The appointment would be at ten 
AM. Woltz had got the message about the possible labour 
strike but hadn’t seemed too impressed, GofiF said. He added, 
‘If it really comes down to tl:^t, 1 gotta talk to the Don 
myself.’ 

‘If it comes to that he’ll talk to you,’ Hagen said. By saying 
this he avoided making any promises. He was not surprised 
that GoflF was so agreeable to the Don’s wishes. The family 
empire, technically, did not extend beyond the New York area 
but Don CorleoiiC had first become strong by helping labour 
leaders. Many of them still owed him debts of friendship. 

But the ten am appointment was a bad sign. It meant that he 
would be first on the appointment list, that he would not be 
invited to lunch. It meant that Woltz held him in small worth. 
Goff had not been threatening enough, probably because 
Woltz had him on his graft payroll. And sometimes the Don’s 
success in keeping himself out of the limelight worked to the 
disadvantage of the family business, in that his name did not 
mean anything to outside circles. 

His analysis proved correct. Woltz kept him waiting for a 
half liour past the appointed time. Hagen didn’t mind. The 
reception room was very plush, very comfortable, and on a 
plum-coloured couch opposite him sat the most beautiful child 
Hagen had ever seen. She was no more than eleven or twelve, 
dressed in a very expensive but simple way as a grown woman. 
She had incredibly golden hair, huge deep sea-blue eyes and a 
fresh raspberry-red mouth. She was guarded by a woman 
obviously her mother, who tried to stare Hagen down with a 
cold arrogance that made him want to punch her in the face. 
The angel child and the dragon mother, Hagen thought, 
returning the mother’s cold stare. 

Finally an exquisitely dressed but stout middle-aged woman 
came to lead him through a string of offices to the office-apart- 
ment of the movie producer. Hagen was impressed by the 
beauty of the offices and the people working in them. He 
smiled. They were all shrewdies, trying to get their foot in the 


54 



movie door by taking office jobs, and most of them would 
work in these offices for the rest of their lives or until they 
accepted defeat and returned to their home towns. 

Jack Woltz was a tall, powerfully built man with a heavy 
paunch almost concealed by his perfectly tailored suit. Hagen 
knew his history. At ten years of age Woltz had hustled empty 
beer kegs and pushcarts on the East Side. At twenty he helped 
his father sweat garment workers. At thirty he had left New 
York and moved West, invested in the nickelodeon, and 
pioneered motion pictures. At forty-eight he had been the 
most powerful movie magnate in Hollywood, still rough- 
spoken, rapaciously amorous, a raging wolf ravaging helpless 
flocks of young starlets. At fifty he transformed himself. He 
took speech lessons, learned how to dress from an English 
valet, and how to behave socially from an English buder. 
When his first wife died he married a world-famous and beaud- 
ful actress who didn’t like acting. Now at the age of sixty he 
collected old master paintings, was a member of the President’s 
Advisory Committee, and had set up a multimillion-doUar 
foimdadon in his name to promote art in modon pictures. His 
daughter had married an English lord, his son an Italian 
princess. 

His latest passion, as reported dutifully by every movie 
columnist in America, was his own racing stables on which he 
had spent ten million dollars in the past year. He had made 
headlines by purchasing the funed English racing horse 
Khartoum for the incredible price of six hundred thousand 
dollars and then announcing that the undefeated racer would 
be retired and put to stud exclusively for the Woltz stables. 

He received Hagen courteously, his beautifi^y, evenly 
tanned, meticulously barbered flsce contorted with a grimace 
meant to be a smile. Despite all the money spent, despite die 
ministradons of the most knowledgeable technicians, his age 
showed; the flesh of his face looked as if it had been seamed 
together. But there was an enormous vitality in his movements 
and he had what Don Corleone had, the air of a man who 
commanded absolutely the world in which he lived. 

Hagen came direedy to the point. That he was an emissary 
ftx>m a fnend of Johnny Fontane. That this friend was a very 


55 



powerful man who would pledge his gratitude and undying 
friendship to Mr Woitz if Mr Woltz would grant a small 
favour. The small favour would be the casting of Johnny 
Fontane in the new war movie the studio planned to start next 
week. 

The seamed face was impassive^ polite. ‘What favours can 
your friend do me?’ Woltz asked. There was just a trace of 
condescension in his voice. 

Hagen ignored the condescension. He explained. ‘You’ve 
got some labour trouble coming up. My friend can absolutely 
guarantee to make that trouble disappear. You have a top 
malc'star who makes a lot of money for your studio but he just 
graduated from marijuana to heroin. My friend wili guarantee 
that your male star won’t be able to get any more heroin. And 
if some other little thmgs come up over the years a phone call 
to me can solve your problems.’ 

Jack Woltz listened to this as if he were hearmg the boasting 
of a child. Then he said harshly, his voice deliberately ail Bast 
Side, ‘You trying to put muscle on me?’ 

Hagen said coolly, ‘Absolutely not. I’ve come to ask a 
service for a friend. I’ve tried to explain that you won’t lose 
an 3 rthing by it.* 

Almost as if he willed it, Woltz made his face a mask of 
anger. The mouth curled, his heavy brows, dyed black, con- 
tracted to form a thick line over his glinting eyes. He leaned 
over the desk towards Hagen. ‘All right, you smooth son of a 
bitch, let me lay it on the line for you and your boss, whoever 
he is. Johnny Fontane never gets that movie. I don’t care how 
many guinea Mafia goombahs come out of the woodwork.' 
He leaned back. ‘A word of advice to you, my friend. J. Edgar 
Hoovcf, 1 assume you’ve heard of him ’ - Woltz smiled sar- 
donically - ' IS a personal friend of mine. If I let him know I’m 
being pressured, you guys will never know what hit you.’ 

Hagen listened patiently. He had expected better from a man 
of Woltz’s stature. Was it possible that a man who acted this 
stupidly could rise to the head of a company worth hundreds 
of millions ? That was something to think about since the Don 
was looking for new things to put money into, and if the top 
brains of this industry were so dumb, movies might be the 

56 



thing. The abuse itself bothered him not at all. Hagen had 
learned the art of negotiation from the Don himself. ‘ Nevet 
get angry,’ the Don had instructed. ‘Never make a threat. 
Reason with people.’ The word ‘reason’ sounded so much 
bettei in Italian, rajmahy to rejom. The art of dus was to ignore 
all insults, all threats; to turn the othet cheek. Hagen had seeii 
the Don sii at a negotiating table for eight hours, swallowing 
insults, trying to persuade a notorious and megalomaniac 
strong-arm man to mend his ways. At the end of the eight 
hours Don Corleone had thrown up his hands in a helpless 
gesture and said to the other men at the table, ‘ But no one can 
reason with this fellow,’ and had stalked out of the meeting 
room. The strong-arm man had turned white with fear, 
tsmis&aries were sent to bring the I^ori back into the room. An 
agreement was reached but two months later the strong-arm 
man was shot to death in his favourite barbershop. 

So Plagen started again, speaking in the most ordinary voice. 
‘Look at my card,’ he said. ‘I’m a lawyer. Would I stick my 
neck out? Have I uttered one threatening word? Let me just 
say that I am prepared to meet any condition you name to get 
Johnny Fontane that movie. 1 think I’ve already offered a great 
deal for such a small favour. A favour that I understand it 
would be in your interest to grant. Johnny tells me that you 
admit he would be perfect for that part. And let me say that 
this favour would never be asked if that were not so. In fact, if 
you're worried about your investment, my client would 
finance the picture. But please let me make myself absolutely 
clear. Wc understand your no is no. Nobody can force you or 
is trying to. Wc know about your friendship with Mr Hoover, 
I may add, and my boss respects you for it. He respects that 
relationship very much.’ 

Woltz had been doodling with a huge, red-feathered pen. At 
the mention of money his interest was aroused and he stopped 
doodling. He said patronizingly, ‘This picture is budgeted at 
five million.’ 

Hagen whistled softly to show that he was impressed. Then 
he said very casually, ‘My boss has a lot of friends who back 
his judgement.’ 

For the first time Woltz seemed to take the whole thing 

57 



seriously. He studied Hagen’s card. ‘I never heard of you/ he 
said. ‘I know most of the big lawyers in New York, but just 
who the hell are you?’ 

‘I have one of those dignified corporate practices,’ Hagen 
said dryly. ‘I just handle this one account.’ He rose, ‘I won’t 
take up any more of your time.’ He held out his hand, Woltz 
shook it. Hagen took a few steps towards the door and turned 
to face Woltz again. ‘ I understand you have to deal with a lot 
of people who try to seem more important than they are. In 
my case the reverse is true. Why don’t you check me out with 
our mutual friend? If you reconsider, call me at my hotel.* He 
paused. ‘This may be sacrilege to you, but my client can do 
things for you that even Mr Hoover might find out of his 
range.* He saw the movie producer’s eyes narrowing. Woltz 
was finally getting the message. ‘By the way, 1 admire your 
pictures very much,’ Hagen said in the most fawning voice he 
could manage. ‘I hope you can keep up the good work. Our 
country needs it.* 

Late that afternoon Hagen received a call from the pro- 
ducer’s secretary that a car would pick him up within the hour 
to take him out to Mr Woltz’s country home for dinner. She 
told him it would be about a three-hour drive but that the car 
was equipped with a bar and some hors d’oeuvres. Hagen 
knew that Woltz made the trip in his private plane and 
wondered why he hadn’t been invited to make the trip by air. 
The secretary’s voice was adding politely, ‘ Mr Woltz suggested 
you bring an overnight bag and he’ll get you to the airport in 
the morning.’ 

‘I’ll do that,’ Hagen said. That was another thing to wonder 
about. How did Woltz know he was taking the morning plane 
back tb New York? He thought about it for a moment. The 
most likely explanation was that Woltz had set private de- 
tectives on his trail to get all possible information. Then Woltz 
certainly knew he represent^ the Don, which meant that he 
knew something about the Don, which in turn meant that he 
was now ready to take the whole matter seriously. Something 
might be done after all, Hagen thought. And maybe Woltz 
was smarter than he had appoired this morning. 



The home of Jack Wolt 2 looked likc^ an implausible movie 
set. There was a plantation-type mansion, huge grounds 
girdled by a rich black dirt bridle path, stables and pasture for 
a herd of horses. The hedges, flower beds, and grasses were as 
carefully manicured as a movie star’s nails. 

Wolta greeted Hagen on a glass-panel air-conditioned porch. 
The producer was informally dressed in blue silk shirt open at 
the neck, mustard-coloured slacks, soft leather sandals. 
Framed in all this colour and rich flibric his seamed, tough face 
Was startling. He handed Hagen an outsked martini glass and 
took one for himself from the prepared tray. He seemed more 
friendly than he had been earlier in the day. He put his arm 
over Hagen’s shoulder and said, * We have a little time before 
dinner, let’s go look at my horses.’ As they walked towards the 
stables he said, "1 checked you out, Tom; you should have 
told me your boss is Corleone. 1 thought you were just some 
third-rate hustler Johnny was running in to bluff me. And I 
don’t blufl. Not that I want to make enemies, 1 never believed 
in that. But let’s just enjoy ourselves now. We can talk 
business after dinner.’ 

Surprisingly Woitz proved to be a truly considerate host. 
He explained his new methods, innovations that he hoped 
would make his stable the most successful in America. The 
stables were all fire-proofed, sanitked to the highest degree, 
and guarded by a special security detail of private detectives. 
FinaUy Woitz led him to a stall which had a huge bronze 
plaque attached to its outside wall. On the plaque was the 
name ^Khartoum’. 

The horse inside the stall was, even to Hagen’s inex- 
perienced eyes, a beautiful animal. Khartoum’s skin was jet 
black except for a diamond-shaped white patch on his huge 
forehead. The great brown eyes glinted like golden apples, the 
black skin over the taut body was silk. Woitz said with childish 
pride, ‘The greatest racehorse in the world. I bought him in 
England last year for six hundred grand. I bet even the 
Russian Czars never paid that much for a single horse. But I’m 
not going to race hixn, I’m going to put him to stud. Fm going 
to build the greatest racing stable this country has ever 
known.’ He stroked die horse^s mane and called out sofdy,

'Khartoum, Khartoum.* There was real love in his voice and 
the animal responded. Woltz said to Hagen, 'Tm a good 
horseman, you know, and the first time 1 ever rode I was fifty 
years old.* He laughed. 'Maybe one of my grandmothers in 
Russia got raped by a G)ssack and I got his blood.* He tickled 
Khartoum’s belly and said with sincere admiration, ‘ Look at 
that cock on him. 1 should have such a cock.* 

They went back to the mansion to have dinner. It was served 
by three waiters under the command of a butler, the table 
linen and ware were all gold thread and silver, but Hagen 
found the food mediocre. Woltz obviously lived alone, and 
just as obviously was not a man who cared about food. Hagen 
waited until they had both lit up huge Havana cigars before he 
asked Woltz, ‘Does Johnny get it or not?’ 

‘I can’t,* Woltz said. ‘I can’t put Johnny into that picture 
even if I wanted to. The contracts arc all signed for all the 
performers and the cameras roll next week. There’s no way I 
can swing it.’ 

Hagen said impatiently, ‘Mr Woltz, the big advantage of 
dealing with a man at the top is that such an excuse is not valid. 
You can do anything you want to do.* He puffed on his cigar. 
‘ Don’t you believe my client * 2 ah keep his promises ? ’ 

Woltz said dryly, ‘I believe that I’m going to have labour 
trouble. Goff called me up on that, the son of a bitch, and the 
way he talked to me you’d never guess I pay him a hundred 
grand a year under the table. And I believe you can get that 
fag he-man star of mine off heroin. But I don’t care about that 
and 1 can finance my own pictures. Because 1 hate that bastard 
Fontane. Tell your boss tliis is one favour 1 can’t give but that 
he should try me again on anything else. Anything at all.’ 

Hagdn tliought, you sneaky bastard, then why the hell did 
you bring me all the way out here? The producer had some- 
thing on his mind. Hagen said coldly, ‘I don’t think you 
understand the situation. Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontanc’s 
godfather. That is a very close, a very sacred religious relation- 
ship.* Woltz bowed his head in respect at this reference to re- 
ligion. Hagen went on. ‘Italians have a little joke, that the 
world is so hard a man must have two fathers to look after 
him, and that’s why they have godfathers. Since Johnny’s 

6o 



father died, Mr Corleone feels his responsibility even more 
deeply. As for trying you again, Mr Corleone is much too 
sensitive. He never asks a second favour where he has been 
refused the first/ 

Woltz shrugged. ‘Tm sorry. The answer is still no. But since 
you'^rc here, what will it cost me to have that labour trouble 
cleared up? In czsh. Right now.' 

That solved one puzzle for Hagen. Why Woltz was putting 
in so much time on him when he had already decided not to 
give Johnny the part. And that could not be changed at this 
mteeting. Woltz felt secure; he was not afraid of the power of 
Don Corleone. And certainly Woltz with his national political 
connexions, his acquaintanceship with the FBI chief, his 
huge personal fortune, and his absolute power in the film 
industry, could not feel threatened by Don Corleone. To any 
intelligent man, even to Hagen, it seemed that Woltz had 
correctly assessed his position. He was impregnable to the Don 
if he was willing to take the losses the labour struggle would 
cost. There was only one thing wrong with the whole equa- 
tion. Don Corleone liad promised his godson he would get the 
part and Don Corleone had never, to Hagen's knowledge, 
broken his word in such matters. 

Hagen said quietly, * You arc deliberately misimdcrstanding 
me. You are trying to make me an accomplice to extortion. Mr 
Corleone promises only to .speak in your favour on this labour 
trouble as a Oiatter of friendsnip in return for your speaking in 
behalf of liis client. A friendly exchange of influence, nothing 
more. But 1 can see you don't take me seriously. Personally, 1 
think that is a mistake.' 

Woltz. as if he had been waiting for such a moment, let him- 
self get angry. ‘I understood perfectly,' he said, ‘that's the 
Mafia style, isn't it? All oiivc oil and sweet talk when what 
you're really doing is making threats. So let me lay it on the 
line. Johnny Fontana will never get that part and he’s perfect 
for it. It would make him a great star. But he never will be 
because I hate that pinko punk and I’m going to run him out of 
the movies. And I'll tell you why. He ruined one of my most 
valuable profegdes. For five years 1 had this girl under train- 
ing, singing, dancing, acting lessons, I spent hundreds of 

6i 



thousands of dollars. I was going to make her a star. I’ll be even 
more frank, just to show you that I’m not a hard-hearted man, 
that it wasn’t all dollars and cents. That girl was beautiful and 
she was the greatest piece of ass I’ve ever had and I’ve had them 
all over the world. She could suck you out like a water pump. 
Then Johnny comes along with that olive-oil voice and guinea 
charm and she runs off. She threw it all away just to make me 
ridiculous. A man in my position, Mr Hagen, can’t afford to 
look ridiculous. I have to pay Johnny off.’ 

For the first time, Woltz succeeded in astounding Hagen. 
He found it inconceivable that a grown man of substance 
would let such trivialities affect his judgement in an affair of 
business, and one of such importance. In Hagen’s world, the 
Corlcones’ world, the physical beauty, the sexual power of 
women, carried not the slightest weight in worldly matters. It 
was a private affair, except, of course, in matters of marriage 
and family disgrace. Hagen decided to make one last try. 

‘You are absolutely right, Mr Woltz,’ Hagen said. ‘But are 
your grievances that major? I don’t think you’ve understood 
how important this very small favour is to my client. Mr 
Corleone held the infant Johnny in his arms when he was 
baptized. When Johnny’s father died, Mr Q>rleone assumed 
the duties of parenthood, indeed he is called “Godfather” by 
many people who wish to show their respect and gratitude for 
the help he has given them, Mr Corleone never lets his friends 
down.’ 

Woltz stood ^p abruptly. ‘I’ve listened to about enough. 
Thugs don’t give me orders, I give them orders. If I pick up 
this phone, you’ll spend the night in jail. And if that Mafia 
goombah tries any rough stuff, he’ll find out I’m not a band 
leader. Yeah, I heard that story too. Listen, your Mr Corleone 
will never know what hit him. Even if I have to use my 
influence at the White House.’ 

The stupid, stupid son of a bitch. How the hell did he get to 
be a pev^nwantty Hagen wondered. Advisor to the President, 
head of the biggest movie studio in the world. Definitely the 
Don should get into the movie business. And the guy was 
taking his words at their sentimental face value. He was not 
getting the message. 


6i 



*Thank yoa for the dimier and a pleasant evening,’ Hagen 
said. 'Could you give me transportation to the airport? 1 don’t 
think I’ll spend the night.’ He smiled coldly at Wolt 2 . 'Mr 
Corleone is a man who insists on hearing bad news at once/ 

While waiting in the floodlit colonnade of the mansion for 
his car, Hagen saw two women about to enter a long limousine 
already parked in the driveway. They were the beautiful 
twelve-year-old blonde girl and her mother ^e had seen in 
Woltz’s oflice that morning. But now the girl’s exquisitely cut 
mouth seemed to have smeared into a thick, pink mass. Her 
sea-blue eyes were Aimed over and when she walked down the 
steps towards the open car her long legs tottered like a crippled 
foal’s. Her mother supported the child, helping her into the 
car, hissing commands into her ear. The mother’s head turned 
for a quick furtive look at Hagen and he saw in her eyes a 
burning, hawklike triumph. Then she too disappeared into the 
limousine. 

So that was why he hadn’t got the plane ride from Los 
Angeles, Hagen thought. The girl and her mother had made 
the trip with the movie producer. That had given Woltz 
enough time to relax before dinner and do the job on the little 
kid. And Johnny wanted to live in this world? Good luck to 
him, and good luck to Woltz. 

Paulie Gatto hated quickie jobs, especially when they in- 
volved violence. He liked to plan things ahead. And some- 
thing like tonight, even though it was punk stuff, could turn 
into serious business if somebody made a mistake. Now, 
sipping his beer, he glanced around, checking how the two 
young punks were making out with the two little tramps at the 
bar. 

Paulie Gatto knew everything there was to know about 
those two punks. Their names were Jerry Wagner and Kevin 
Moonan. They were both about twenty years old, good-look- 
ing, brown-haired, tall, well-built. Both were due to go back 
to college out of town in two weeks, both had fathers with 
political influence and this, with their college student classifi- 
cation, had so far kept them out of the draft. Hiey were both 
also under suspended sentences for assaulting the daughter of 

65 



Amerigo Bonasera. The lou87 bastards, Paulic Gatto thought. 
Draft dodging, violating their probation by drinking in a 
bar after midnight, chasing floozies. Young punks. Paulie 
Gatto had been deferred from the draft himself because 
his doctor had furnished the draft board with documents 
showing that this patient, male, white, aged twenty-six, un- 
married, had received electrical shock treatments for a mental 
condition. All false of course, but Paulie Gatto felt that he 
bad earned his draft exemption. It had been arranged by 
Ciemenza after Gatto had ‘made his bones’ in the family 
business. 

It was Ciemenza who had told him that this job must be. 
rashed through, before the boys went to college. Why the hell 
did it have to be done in New York, Gatto wondered. Clc- 
menza was always giving extra orders instead of just giving 
out the job. Now if those two little tramps walked out with 
the punks it would be another night wasted. 

He could hear one of the girls laughing and saying, ‘Are you 
crazy, Jerry? Tm not going in any car with you. i don't want 
to wind up in the hospital like that other poor girl.’ Her voice 
was spitefully rich with satisfaction. That was enough for 
Gatto, He finished up his beer and walked out into the dark 
street. Perfect. It was after midnight. There was only one other 
bar that showed light. The rest of the stores were closed. The 
precinct patrol car had been taken care of by Ciemenza. They 
wouldn’t be aiound that way until they got a radio call and 
then they’d come slow. 

He leaned against the four-door Chevy sedan. In the back 
scat two men were sitting, almost invisible, although they 
were very big men. Paulie said, ‘Take them when they come 
out.’ 

He still thought it had all been set up too fast. Ciemenza had 
given him copies ot the police mug shots of the two punks, the 
dope on where the punks went drinking every ni ght to pick up 
bar girls. Paulie had recruited two of the strong-arms in the 
family and fingered the punks for them. He had also given 
them their instructions. No blows on the top or the back of the 
head, there was to be no accidental fetality. Other «-han that 
they could go as far as they liked. He bad given them only one 

64 



warning; *If those punks get out of the hospital in less than a 
month, you guys go back to driving trucks/ 

The two big men were getting out of the car. They were 
both ex-boxers who Had never made it past the small clubs and 
had been fixed up by Sonny Corleone with a little loan-shark 
action so that they could make a decent living. They were, 
naturally, anxious to show their gratitude. 

When Jerry Wagner and Kevin Moonan came out of the bar 
they were perfect setups. The bar girl’s taunts had left their 
adolescent vanity prickly. Paulie Gatto, leaning against the 
fender of his car, called out to them with a teasing laugh, 
‘Hey, Casanova, those broads really brushed you off.’ 

The two young men turned on him with delight. Paulie 
Gatto looked like a perfect outlet for their humiliation. Ferret- 
faced, short, slightly built, and a wise guy in the bargain. They 
pounced on him eagerly and immediately found their arms 
pinned by two men grabbing them from behind. At the same 
moment Paulie Gatto had slipped onto his right hand, a 
specially made set of brass knuckles studded with one- 
sixteenth-inch iron spikes. His timing was good, he worked 
out in the gym three times a week. He smashed the punk 
named Wagner right on the nose. The man holding Wagner 
lifted him up off the ground and Paulie swung his arm, 
uppercutting ii^to the perfectly positioned groin. Wagner 
went Ump and the big man dropped him« This had taken no 
more than six seconds. 

Now both of them turned their attention to Kevin Moonan, 
who was trying to shout. The man holding him from behind 
did so easily with one huge muscled arm. The other hand he 
put around Moonan ’s throat to cut off any sound. , 

Paulie Gatto jumped into the car and started the motor. The 
two big men were beating Moonan to jelly. They did so with 
(ngbtening deliberation, as if they bad all the time in the 
world. They did not throw punches in flurries but in timed, 
slow-motion sequences that carried the full weight of their 
massive bodies. Each blow landed with a jp/a/ of flesh 
splitting open. Gatto got a glimpse of Moonan^s face. It was 
The two mea ieft Mooaaa lying on the a'dc- 

»n tufned tbeir atteatim to Wagaer. Wagaer waa tryiag 



to get to his feet and he started to scream for help. Someone 
came out of the bar and the two men had to work faster now. 
They clubbed Wagner to his knees. One of the men took his 
arm and twisted it, then kicked him in the spine. There was a 
cracking sound and Wagner’s scream of agony brought 
windows open all along the street. The two men worked very 
quickly. One of them held Wagner up by using his two hands 
around Wagner’s head like a vice. The other man smashed his 
huge fist into the fixed target. There were more people coming 
out of the bar but none tried to interfere. Paulie Gatto yelled, 
‘ Come on, enough.* 'Hie two big men jumped into the car and 
Paulie gunned it away. Somebody would describe the car and 
read the licence plates but it didn’t matter. It was a stolen 
California plate and there were one hundred thousand black 
Chevy sedans in New York City.
